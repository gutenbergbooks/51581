</div>


<p>The idea of this little book is to give as clear
and graphic a description of modern aviation as
circumstances will permit; of the new, heroic race
of men to which Flying has given birth; of the
conditions under, and the elements in, which their
work is carried out, and the difficulties and dangers
they have to encounter. Flying is essentially
a profession for the younger generation. The
strain is too great for men of more mature years.
To withstand such strain requires all the vigor,
the recklessness, the iron nerve of youth. It is a
profession that offers an irresistible appeal to
healthy-minded, sport-loving youth, to whom adventure
is the nectar of existence.</p>

<p>The writer’s chief endeavor in the opening
chapters has been to help the young man who
wishes to adopt “Flying” as a profession. <a href="#PART_II">Part
II</a> of the book is composed of a collection of
incidents taken from the diary of an air pilot on
Active Service somewhere in the North of France.
They are given in their original form. I also wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
to thank the editors of the <cite>Daily Mail</cite>, <cite>Daily
Express</cite>, <cite>Daily Chronicle</cite>, <cite>Evening News</cite>, and
<cite>Boys’ Friend</cite> for their courtesy in permitting me
to use, in a few instances, material embodied in
articles appearing in their journals.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p>In writing of modern aviation it is to be regretted
that the sport or science, call it what you
will, was developed more in two years by the war
than would have been possible in twenty-two
years under normal conditions. Prior to 1914 we
did not look upon aircraft and aviation with the
degree of interest that their useful qualities warranted.
Instead we were apt to regard them rather
in the manner of a sporting spectacle, in much the
same light as a football match, or a boxing entertainment,
or as the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pièce de résistance</i> of the showmen;
thus aircraft, the greatest and most potential
discovery of all the ages, had to prove their worth
in the maiming of humanity and the destruction
of property.</p>

<p>Quietly and unobtrusively they were introduced
into the plans of war; it must be admitted greatly
despised and with a strong feeling of repugnance.
Gradually—so gradually as almost to be unnoticed—they
began to prove their worth.</p>

<p>From the very first days of the war it began to
be realized that we must have aircraft. Our large
Navy was in desperate need of seaplanes to hunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the enemy warships from their lairs and his merchantmen
from the seas. In the same way our tiny
Army required aeroplanes, but for a somewhat
different reason: to be prepared against all enemy
surprises, which in those desperate days of early
1914 would have been fatal.</p>

<p>As the war developed, the various belligerents
began to settle down, to restore order from the
chaos, and to prepare for a long and arduous campaign.
Then the cry came for aircraft, more and
more aircraft. In England the great engineering
shops and factories were peremptorily ordered by
the Government to abandon their work and to
construct aeroplanes as fast as they were able.
Meanwhile the enemy, who had long been prepared,
began to obtain an overwhelming mastery
of the air—it will always remain a mystery why he
did not use his aircraft to better effect at Mons
and the Marne. After four and six months, fresh
craft came out from England, and it was then the
enemy, in his turn, was driven from the air. For
some time we were allowed to retain that mastery,
then the enemy came along with a rush with the
new and powerful Albatross and Aviatik, and again
we retired into the background for a time. Meanwhile,
aeroplane factories were springing up all
over the country, and the production of machines
was going up by leaps and bounds;—undeniable
proof this of the value such craft were to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
military commanders. Thus the mad race went
on. Fast, graceful, single-seater scouts, slower
and larger reconnaissance craft; huge, powerful-engined
battle-planes made their appearance in
quantities hitherto undreamt of, and were dispatched
in never-ending stream across the Channel,
there to play their part in the war.</p>

<p>Dipping into the past, it may be said that by
1784 flight by balloon was well under way, and
that year a woman—Madame Thible—made a
trip in the presence of King Gustavus III of Sweden,
that lasted three-quarters of an hour. She
reached an altitude of 9000 feet. The following
year the first cross-channel trip was made by
Blanchard, with an American doctor named Jefferies
for passenger, together with a supply of
provisions and ballast. This weighed the balloon
down to so great an extent that she almost sank
into the sea a few moments after starting. Ballast
was thrown overboard and she rose, only to sink
down again. Hurriedly more ballast was dropped,
but it had no effect, and was followed by everything
on which the aeronauts could lay their hands,
including provisions, books and a mass of correspondence.
At last the French coast loomed into
view, but the balloon was now sinking rapidly.
The wings were thrown overboard, but that had no
effect. The aeronauts commenced to strip themselves
of their clothing. Then Jefferies proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
to jump over the side into the water, and was
about to do so, when the balloon rose suddenly
into the air, and they landed on the hills behind
Calais.</p>

<p>Aircraft played a great part in the Franco-Prussian
war, and during the siege of Paris alone
as many as 66 balloons left the stricken city, carrying
60 pilots, 102 passengers, 409 carrier pigeons,
9 tons of letters and telegrams, and 6 dogs. Five
of the dogs were sent back to Paris, but were lost
and never heard of again, while 57 of the carrier
pigeons carried 100,000 messages. Of the 66
balloons 58 got through, 5 fell into German hands,
and 2 into the sea.</p>

<p>Among the more historical trips is that of
Gaston Tissandier, who went over the German
lines, and dropped 10,000 copies of a proclamation
addressed to the soldiers, asking for peace,
yet declaring that France would fight to the bitter
end.</p>

<p>In South Africa an observation balloon was in
use at Ladysmith for twenty-nine days, doing
extremely useful work in spotting the Boer artillery.
The pilot of an observation balloon reported
the enemy’s position on Spionkop to be impregnable,
and, at Paardeberg, another disclosed the
precise position of Cronje’s force and directed our
artillery fire thereon.</p>

<p>Of all the Great Powers, Italy is more responsible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
perhaps, than any other for the evolution of
aircraft. From the sixteenth century the most
accomplished Italian scientists have given their
attention to the solving of the riddle of the air.
Such names as Leonardo da Vinci and Fausto
Varanzio stand out prominently in the history of
aviation; and to-day the Italian rigid airships are
the best in the world. It was, however, mainly
due to the efforts of two Frenchmen that prominence
was first given to aircraft. Joseph and
Stephen Montgolfier were the sons of a rich paper-maker
of Annoney, and the story goes that, while
rowing, Stephen’s silk coat fell overboard into the
water. When drying the coat it was noticed that
the hot air tended to make it rise, and the upshot
of the affair was the Montgolfier balloon. Since
those days France has devoted herself almost entirely
to the development of aeroplanes, which are
second only to those of German manufacture. To
the latter power honor, however unwilling, must
be given as regards aircraft. On the outbreak of
war her aeroplanes were the finest in the world,
and her Zeppelins were beyond comparison. Great
Britain possessed an advantageous lead in the
matter of aeroplanes.</p>

<p>The development of aviation in this country
was mainly due to the untiring efforts of the Royal
Aero Club affiliated to the Fédération Aéronique
International; and the splendid encouragement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of the proprietors of the <cite>Daily Mail</cite>, who generously
put aside an aggregate sum of £37,000
towards prize-money for aeronautical events. The
Fédération Aéronique had already branches in
America, Argentine, Austria, Belgium, Britain,
Denmark, France, Germany, Holland, Hungary,
Italy, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland. In England the R.A.C. controlled
every matter connected with aviation, such as the
arranging and governing of competitions, the
granting of pilots’ certificates, and the ruling of
the air. Up to August, 1914, they had already
granted 926 certificates, of which 863 were aeroplane,
24 airship and 39 aeronaut (balloon). The
first of their competitions for the Britannia Challenge
Trophy was carried off by Captain C. A. N.
Longcroft, R.F.C., in 1913 with a flight from
Montrose to Farnborough via Portsmouth, a distance
in a direct line of 445 miles. It was the
R.A.C. that arranged the <cite>Daily Mail</cite> competitions,
several of which have yet to be carried out,
including the £10,000 Cross-Atlantic (by aeroplane).
The <cite>Daily Mail</cite> International Cross-country
flight for £1,000 was won by Louis
Blériot, July 25, 1909: it is needless to remark
that this flight has now become an everyday occurrence.
The £10,000 London to Manchester flight
was awarded to Louis Paulhan (France). The
second £10,000 circuit of Britain of 1010 miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
was carried off by André Beaumont; and J. T. C.
Brabazon was successful in the National <cite>Daily
Mail</cite> £1000 for a flight of one mile in an All
British machine.</p>

<p>The highest altitude that had been reached in
Great Britain was 14,920 feet; the greatest distance
flown 287 miles; and the longest duration 8
hours 23 minutes.</p>

<p>Whether we were prepared for the war is a
matter for too extensive a discussion for this little
book, but the fact remains that the number of
firms engaged in the manufacturing of aeroplanes
could be counted on both hands, and that we were
without a useful and reliable engine of British
construction.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>JOINING THE SERVICE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The Air Service is young, very young; it is like
an overgrown schoolboy, strong, healthy and full
of life, but lacking just that sense of proportion
that distinguishes the schoolboy from the man.
It is wise, for it is endowed with the wisdom of
initiative, courage and resource. Turned loose
into an entirely novel and little understood element,
it has had to create its own methods of
procedure, its own ideals, its own traditions.
Reference to the policies and the formulas of past
generations are impossible, for there are none!</p>

<p>The main principles of aerial warfare are entirely
new; in every combat, and in every raid,
some precedent is established, some new form or
theory of attack is set up. To the airman every
day is alike. In times of peace he risks his neck
as much as he does in time of war, save that
engaged in the latter he has the additional unpleasantness
of shell fire. He willingly gives all,
but asks for nothing. He is the knight-errant of
the twentieth century.</p>

<p>In days of the past, it was the cavalryman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
wounded and galloping across country, with a
hundred foemen hard at his heels, who first
brought news of the enemy to the general in command.
His was a pleasant occupation, that
smacked largely of daring and romance. He stood
an excellent chance of getting a bullet through his
lungs, or of being clapped into an enemy prison.
To-day there comes flying across the heavens a
resolute young hero, in a few feet of wood and
fabric, throwing defiance to shot and shell alike,
suspended thousands of feet up between heaven
and earth, peering from that swaying aeroplane
at the panorama of the earth beneath.</p>

<p>This is the age of science and invention. War
on and over the earth, on and under the sea. For
many years we have steadily been putting behind
us the barbarities of our forbears, we have become
more civilized, and, though more civilized,
more barbarous. This is no paradox; science has
made great and wonderful strides, but science has
been more devilishly ingenious than any torture
of Spanish Inquisition days.</p>

<p>The airmen who pilot their frail craft over hill
and valley, sea and land, across cloud and through
fog and mist, are the privateers of modern times;
but for them there can be no capture, no quarter:
only victory or a thousand feet drop to the cruel
earth below. Through their young veins must
flow the blood of a Drake, of a Philip Sidney, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a Nelson. Theirs must be the courage of a conqueror,
the heart of a lion, the nerve of a colossus.</p>

<p>No bounded ocean is their sea, but the infinity
of space. The ship’s compass is their best friend;
for they maneuver their craft like a ship at sea.
Wind and weather affect them as they would a
mariner. For rock, shoal, sandbank and channel
there are the high hills, the tall factory stack, the
church steeple, and the deep valley. Landmarks
there are, but always below, not on either side.
Railways, roads, rivers, fields, woods and hills
form the color scheme of the surface of the earth,
by which the air pilot steers a course.</p>

<p>This, the youngest and most important Service,
is essentially one <em>for</em> the young man and <em>of</em> the
young man: a Service the future of which is being
steadily built up by the “muddied oafs and
flanneled fools” of the playing-fields of the public
schools of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Immediately after leaving school is the most
perplexing period in a boy’s life. Not only for
the boy himself, but for his parents, for then has
to be considered his future career. What is the
boy capable of? What are his own personal
wishes? What profession is he best adapted for
physically? It is indeed a momentous question.</p>

<p>It is worse than useless for the boy fond of
good, wholesome, out-of-door exercises and games
to be put into an office or to study for the Bar, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to mope his young life away pen-driving. And,
on the other hand, it is a positive torture for the
youth with distinct literary taste, or love of things
scholastic, to take up a Commission in one of the
Services, or to go in for farming or a similar
profession.</p>

<p>Taking everything into consideration, at least
eighty per cent. of boys may be grouped into the
former class—that is to say, they wish to adopt
a healthy, open-air profession; and for this type
of youth nothing can be better, and nothing can
offer greater inducements, than the profession of
the airman. It is a calling that appeals irresistibly
to a boy’s heart.</p>

<p>The best possible training for the pilot of the
air are outdoor sports and games. Football,
which teaches the boy to keep his head in all
emergencies, to keep his feelings always well under
control, and to learn to obey implicitly the discipline
of the referee’s whistle will prove invaluable
to him when learning to fly, when he will be subject
to every kind and manner of unexpected and
sudden mishap and accident.</p>

<p>Cricket will teach him patience, judgment—so
invaluable when landing an aeroplane (which, incidentally,
is by far the most difficult feat to
accomplish in flying)—and a steady eye.</p>

<p>Swimming and running will develop those muscles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of the back and thigh which are used extensively
in the pilotage of the aeroplanes.</p>

<p>Again, the sensation of a horse jumping a hedge
is exactly similar to that of an aeroplane just
getting off from the ground. With ski-ing, on
the other hand, there is the feeling—and, in fact,
the action—of plunging desperately into what, at
the first attempt, appears to be an interminable
and awful space. This is exactly the feeling
experienced by the novice in his first trip up aloft.
There is a strong similarity to ski-ing at the
moment that the nose of the machine is suddenly
put down, and she commences to sink rapidly
towards the earth.</p>

<p>The next matter to be taken into consideration
is that of physical peculiarities. The would-be
pilot must be neither too tall nor too short. This
is essentially a matter to do with the steering of
the aeroplane. If he is too tall, he will find himself
very cramped in the confined space between
the pilot-seat and the rudder-bar. If he is too
short he will discover that his legs will not be long
enough to reach that all-important adjunct.</p>

<p>Again with regard to weight, for preference he
should be on the light side. There is not very
much room in an aeroplane, and, for reasons with
which we will deal, the machine is only capable
of lifting up to a certain weight.</p>

<p>Take into consideration that an aeroplane is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
often required to take up two passengers, not to
mention bombs, grenades, spare petrol and a
machine-gun; every extra pound of weight is of
the utmost importance.</p>

<p>His stomach must be strong, for with a weak
stomach he will be liable to air-sickness.</p>

<p>Further, he must be possessed of good health.
He must not suffer from heart trouble. It has
been proved by several very eminent doctors that
the rise and the descent through the various altitudes
of the atmosphere effect the heart greatly.</p>

<p>Again, he must have good eyesight. This is
imperative, for the best part of his work will take
place at an altitude of ten thousand feet above the
earth. The best age for an air pilot is between
nineteen and twenty-four.</p>

<p>The life of a pilot—that is to say, his flying
life—varies from three to five years; I may say
eighteen months under war conditions. Never
more. The great strain on the nerves, although
not felt at the time, begins to make itself apparent
after two years of flying; then the pilot discovers
that he is no longer so keen on going up as he
was, that he gets “cold feet” more frequently than
he was wont to do in the early days, that he has
no longer the nerve to do the little tricks, upon the
performance of which he formerly prided himself.</p>

<p>A good air-pilot must be born so, he cannot be
made. After years of experience a man may become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
expert in trick flying, landing, getting off,
etc.; but, however long and however diligently
he may strive, he can never become the equal of
the natural pilot.</p>

<p>Before applying for a Commission in either
Service the aspirant to flying honors must first
decide which of the two branches he wishes to take
up. The two branches, by the way, are pilotage
and observation. The difference between the two
I will here briefly endeavor to explain.</p>

<p>The pilot is concerned with the flying of the
machine, the care of the engine, spare parts, etc.,
and is responsible for the general condition of the
craft; also to see that it is properly tested before
each flight.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the observer has a great
many subjects to learn. He must be at one and
the same time wireless expert, gunner, rifle-shot,
artist, photographer and map-maker. He must
know something about heavy artillery.</p>

<p>The observer in the Royal Flying Corps is given
equal rank to the pilot, but can only wear a half-wing
on his tunic where the pilot has full wings.</p>

<p>In the Royal Naval Air Service observers are
permitted to wear the bird on their sleeve immediately
on joining. However, they are of different
rank from the pilot, being either lieutenants or
sub-lieutenants, Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>THE AIRMAN’S FIRST DAYS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The appointment to a commission in one of
the flying services can be either temporary or permanent.
The former holds good until the end of
the war, the latter for as long as the would-be airman
wishes to retain it. For a period of from
four to six months he must undergo a probationary
course; if after that time he has served
satisfactorily he will be confirmed in his rank.</p>

<p>Upon first joining up he will receive a uniform
allowance of £20, and at the confirmation a further
£20. These amounts should easily cover his
requirements and enable him to buy a complete
flying outfit. During the probationary period he
will receive 14<i>s.</i> a day in pay; when he is confirmed
in rank, 18<i>s.</i> a day in the Royal Naval Air
Service, and 20<i>s.</i> per day in the Royal Flying
Corps.</p>

<p>Service etiquette plays a prominent part in the
matter of uniform. In the military wing he will
be expected to wear the button-over tunic and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
forage cap of the Flying Corps, with breeches and
long brown field-boots.</p>

<p>In the R.N.A.S. the matter of dress is a more
difficult and more delicate one. In the first place,
with regard to the cap, there are four entirely
separate badges in the Naval Service: they are
(1) the big silver anchor and the gold crown of
the regular Navy; (2) the smaller replica of the
Royal Naval Reserve; and of the Royal Naval
Volunteer Reserve, to which latter branch the
aeroplane observer always belongs; and lastly the
silver bird of the R.N.A.S., worn only by pilots.</p>

<p>In hosiery the naval flying man must confine
his taste to plain white shirts with collars to
match; black ties, and socks of the plain black variety.
His shoes must be unadorned of toecap, and
it is a cardinal sin to leave the buttons of his
jacket undone, if he reveal as much as a button
of the waistcoat beneath.</p>

<p>There is an amusing story told concerning a
famous English airman who has since resigned
from the R.N.A.S. On the occasion of his appointment
to the Service he had to visit a certain
big man at the Admiralty, and arrived there in the
brass hat of a full-blown naval commander, with
a black-and-white striped tie, in which there coyly
reposed a large diamond pin.</p>

<p>When the interview was over the big man called
him back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ve forgotten something.”</p>

<p>“What is it, sir?” the airman inquired.</p>

<p>“Your pink shirt and your purple socks,” was
the reply.</p>

<p>Another new hand—an Australian—presented
himself to the astonished and apoplectic commanding
officer of his first station wearing a blue
monkey-jacket, white flannel trousers, green socks,
and brown shoes.</p>

<p>Luckily he was a good-tempered youth, or he
would never have been able to live down the subsequent
ragging he got from all the other members
of his mess.</p>

<p>Flying-clothes must be the warmest procurable:
a black or brown leather coat lined with lamb’s
wool, with trousers to match. Good flying-coats
cost from three to five guineas, and the trousers
range from a guinea to thirty shillings in price.</p>

<p>A khaki balaclava helmet, a wool-lined aviation
cap fitting closely round the skull, and costing
approximately half-a-guinea. A pair of triplex
glass goggles, price 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>—cheaper ones of
ordinary glass can be obtained as cheap as 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>—but
it is always advisable to get triplex, as in
the event of a smash-up ordinary glass would
splinter, fly into the eyes and possibly blind one
for life.</p>

<p>A good pair of leather gauntlets, large enough
in size to permit the wearing of a warmer pair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
woolen gloves beneath, and a gray sweater to
wear underneath the leather coat are all that are
required, bringing the total cost to about £6.</p>

<p>As in other professions and walks in life, a
certain slang has sprung into being in flying circles,
and this the new hand will discover will take him
a considerable time to pick up—at least, with any
degree of satisfaction or success.</p>

<p>First he will discover that a “quirk” or a
“hun” is no less a person than a youngster who
aspires to flying honors, and who has not yet
taken his ticket. Even the aeroplanes themselves
have nicknames, as the “Bristol Bullet,” so called
because of its peculiar shape.</p>

<p>Airships and balloons are always referred to—and
somewhat contemptuously, it must be admitted—by
aeroplane pilots as “gasbags.” The
small, silver-colored airships that are to be seen
occasionally floating over a certain western suburb
of London are known in the Service as “Babies,”
on account of their diminutive size; on the other
hand as “Blimps,” and again as “S.S.’s”—submarine
seekers—that being their principal duty
when on active service.</p>

<p>Various parts of the machine have their own
particular nickname, as the “fuselage,” or body
which contains the engine, pilot and observer’s
seats, and the petrol tanks. That wonderful
control lever which is placed immediately before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the pilot’s seat in the fuselage, and which maneuvers
the machine both upwards and downwards,
and to the left and to the right, or, in the
terms used by R.N.A.S., to port and to starboard,
is known as the “joy-stick.” No self-respecting
pilot will ever refer to a trip in the air as such, but
rather as a “joy-ride.” A bomb-dropping expedition
or a raid he speaks of as a “stunt.”</p>

<p>To “nose-dive” is for the front portion of the
machine to plunge suddenly downwards at an
angle of approximately ninety degrees with the
earth. To “pancake,” the aeroplane must fall
flat to the earth. It is possible sometimes to
recover from a “nose-dive,” but never from a
“pancake.” Sometimes in banking—turning in
mid-air—a pilot will overdo the angle at which he
turns; the result is that the machine commences
to rotate, and whirls round like a humming-top;
this, again, invariably develops into a “nose-dive,”
and is known as a “spin.”</p>

<p>The majority of pilots, when first starting off,
run their machines some distance across the aerodrome,
then rise gradually at an angle of about
fifteen degrees with the earth; others, on the other
hand, prefer to run their machine a considerably
greater distance across the ground, and, thus attaining
a much greater speed, to rise almost vertically
for about two hundred feet, then to flatten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
out and bring the machine level: this trick is
known as “zumming.”</p>

<p>To “switchback” is to fly up and down, up
and down, as the name implies.</p>

<p>Immediately after leaving the ground the aeroplane
invariably commences to plunge and to dive
like a ship in a stormy sea—this is when it enters
a patch of rarefied air known as a “bump”; this
latter often causes the machine to drop suddenly,
and drops of as much as two hundred feet at a
time have been recorded.</p>

<p>No airman is capable of talking through his hat—at
least, not literally, for he does not possess
such a thing, that article of his attire always being
referred to as a “gadget.”</p>

<p>To have “cold feet” in the air is to have a bad
attack of nerves or funk. One day at Hendon,
before the war, a well-meaning but somewhat
dense journalist attached to a big London daily
was told Hamel was suffering from “cold feet.”</p>

<p>Imagining that “cold feet” meant some ailment
of the feet, like chilblains, and solicitous for his
welfare, this enterprising individual approached
the famous airman immediately after his descent
from a trip up above.</p>

<p>“Excuse me asking, but is it true that you suffer
from cold feet, Mr. Hamel?” he asked.</p>

<p>Hamel’s reply is not recorded.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>THE INITIAL FLIGHT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Once in the Service, the R.N.A.S. man may be
selected for one of three branches of flying, namely,
seaplane, aeroplane—which, incidentally, is
far preferable to any other branch, and holds
forth more opportunities of active service—and
kite balloon, probably the safest and most
comfortable job of the war, but dull—deadly
dull.</p>

<p>For the sake of those of my readers who do not
know of the captive kite-balloon, I will here briefly
explain. It is a queer sausage-shaped craft, that
is tethered to a steam-winch on the ground somewhere
beneath it by means of a stout steel cable.
Usually situated some five or six miles behind the
firing-line, the basket of the balloon will only hold
two observers at one time. It is connected to the
big guns by telephone, and is useful for the direction
of artillery fire, which it does by telling the
men at the guns whether their shells are falling
over, under, or to the left or right of the target
that they are aiming at.</p>

<p>The first day in the life of the “new hand” at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the Service school is not always the pleasantest of
memories. He discovers that, from a man of
parts, he has suddenly been converted into a very
junior sub, and is at the beck and call of every
member of the mess, with as much or more gold
braid on the sleeve of their uniform.</p>

<p>For the first few days he is allowed to wander
round at his own sweet will, in order to get the
hang of things. To him the matter of greatest
importance are the machines, for very often he has
never even seen an aeroplane at close quarters, and
should he be foolish enough to ask absurd questions,
he will always find some one ready with a
fitting answer.</p>

<p>He will be told wondrous stories of the time the
machines will remain in the air, the breakneck
speed at which they will travel, and of the enormous
height to which they will climb.</p>

<p>The next most important thing to the actual
flying is a thorough knowledge of wireless telegraphy,
for without a wireless instrument on board
an aeroplane is little better than useless to the
army in the field; and, having got the wireless set
on board, the pilot or the observer—whosesoever
duty it is—must be able to send messages, clearly
and distinctly, on the Morse key.</p>

<p>A good tip to the youngster thinking of taking
up flying for a profession is to buy a copy of the
Morse code, and learn it off by heart. Then to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
get a “buzzer” or a Morse key (both of which
can be obtained for the sum of 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>), and to
teach himself to read by sound.</p>

<p>In Service circles the dot and the dash of the
Morse code are known as “iddy” and “umpty,”
respectively. It is a simple matter to learn to
send and to receive wireless signals; but to know
how to erect and dismantle a wireless set, and to
have a sound knowledge of the theory and the
working of the thing, and to be able to take to
pieces or to repair at a moment’s notice, any
portion of the instrument that may get out of
order, is a more difficult matter.</p>

<p>That requires several months to acquire, but the
“Quirk” will be given a useful, though somewhat
“short,” course under an expert wireless operator
before he is expected to know these things.</p>

<p>At last the great day arrives when he goes for
his first trip up aloft. After donning a leather
coat, and trousers to match, a skull cap and goggles,
he is ready for the fray, and sits himself
gingerly beside what at the first seems to him to
be a particularly violent and a particularly ill-disposed
individual with a simple wonderful flow
of language, an instructor in a “box-kite.” Then
the engine is set going.</p>

<p>The instructor bawls some remark into his ear,
which, for the life of him, he cannot catch. A
long and rapid journey across the bumpy ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
a weird sensation of rising into space and he is
up in the air at last. Then the machine gets into
the “bumps”; she dips, and drops, and sways, first
to one side and then to the other, until the poor
unfortunate individual begins to wonder if he will
ever get safely to the ground again.</p>

<p>There is a pandemonium of noise. The wind
rushes by his face at an alarming rate. He feels
himself perspiring all over, and particularly in the
palms of his hands. He grips the nearest available
object, as a drowning man would clutch at a
straw. With every fresh plunge and dip he increases
that grip.</p>

<p>The instructor shouts at him at the top of his
voice, but he hears nothing; only the racing engine
and the whistle of the wind. And then for the
first time he ventures to look over the side. Could
that curiously-scattered collection of pigmy buildings,
long, ribbon-like roads, and distant, narrow,
gleaming line of railway line be the earth?</p>

<p>He decides that it is, and is at last beginning to
feel comfortable, when the machine begins to heel
over violently; it is the worst shock that he has yet
had. He grips with both hands as tight as he is
able, shuts his eyes, and waits for the worst. By
the time his eyes are open again the machine—by
what seems to him to have been a miracle—has
righted itself and is flying smoothly through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
air. Never before has the world appeared so
beautiful nor so diminutive in size.</p>

<p>For another five minutes or so the instructor
flies to and fro above the aerodrome, then down
goes the machine, much to the astonishment and
alarm of the bewildered “quirk,” who suddenly
finds the earth rushing up to meet him. How he
fears that moment when a landing must be made,
and how relieved he feels when he realizes there
is nothing in it in the least degree terrifying.</p>

<p>Very gently the aeroplane skims on to the landing-ground,
like a seagull lighting in the crest of
a wave, and all is over; he is safe back again on
Mother Earth. Silent and subdued, he clambers
out of the aeroplane. How did he enjoy it?
“Very much indeed,” he answers in a husky whisper,
and the instructor turns his head away and
smiles. He has taken “quirks” up before.</p>

<small>THE PERILS OF THE AIR</small></h2>
</div>


<p>For the first few trips up aloft the beginner is
always accompanied by an instructor. First he is
taken up as a passenger, and his only duty is to sit
in the observer’s seat and do nothing. Then
gradually he is allowed to fly the machine himself.
This he does in a double-control—that is to say,
an aeroplane with two sets of controls, one of
which the instructor makes use of and the other is
in his own hands.</p>

<p>He is taught that every movement of the control
must be slow and gentle, otherwise the machine
is sure to lose its stability—balance—and go crashing
to the ground below; that an inch too much
with the rudder-bar will invariably mean a “spin,”
or a too jerky movement on the control-bar a
“pancake” or a “nose-dive.”</p>

<p>Getting off from the ground is a comparatively
simple matter; but the moment of first entering the
air is the most dangerous and trying of all. Should
the engine fail, the chances are a hundred to one
that the machine will crash into a hedge, or a tree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
or land in a valley. The “bumps” are most frequent
over houses and buildings, and particularly
so on a dull morning, when the sun is breaking
through the clouds, which send the craft plunging
and tossing in all directions. This is the test that
will show if a man is a good pilot or no.</p>

<p>Once clear of the “bumps,” the first thing to
be done is to get “height.” With a ship at sea
the safest sailing is in mid-ocean, far from the
land. In a similar manner, the greater the altitude
the safer is the flying.</p>

<p>When near the ground, the air-pilot has very
little choice in landing-places and very little time
to prepare for a landing. The higher up he is,
the greater range of country he has to choose
from, and the more time he has to regain control
of his machine.</p>

<p>At a rough estimate, one may say that at a
height of 500 feet he has only an area of a square
half-mile to land in; at 1000 a mile; 2000 two
miles; 5000 five miles; 10,000 ten miles, and so
forth. Some few months ago a pilot at Brooklands
flew up to a height of about 15,000 feet,
shut his engine dead off, and glided down into
Hendon aerodrome a distance of just over twenty
miles.</p>

<p>Having got clear of the “bumps,” the next
danger is the clouds, which have a very strange
effect on the stability of the craft. They should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
always be avoided when possible. Fog is a very
terrible element to encounter in mid-air, and the
sensation of being fog-bound is the worst that the
human brain can conceive. Nothing in sight, with
the blinding fog on either side, and not knowing
any moment that he will not be colliding with some
high points of the earth, the air-pilot positively
dreads the fog.</p>

<p>The writer remembers well the case of an airman
fog-bound last winter at an aerodrome near
London. For two hours he was flying up and
down, up and down, over the aerodrome, without
being able to find it. The spectators on the
ground could hear the hum of his engine distinctly,
but could not see him, and neither could he see
them. Eventually, with the aid of landing-flares
and Verey’s lights, he was able to land; but for
weeks afterwards was a nervous wreck, and could
not fly again for nearly a month.</p>

<p>After several trips with the instructor, and having
satisfied that individual that he has gained
sufficient knowledge of flying, the “quirk” is allowed
to take up a machine by himself.</p>

<p>At first he flies it up and down, over the aerodrome,
then gradually gets on to left and right
hand turns, and then to landing the machine.</p>

<p>Now, landing is the most difficult feat of all in
flying; it requires both good judgment and good
nerves. Before landing the pilot must discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the direction of the prevailing wind. This he can
do by watching the smoke of a high chimney, or
of the locomotive of a railway train. Having discovered
the direction of the wind, he must land
dead against it, otherwise the machine will be
caught in a sudden gust and toppled over.</p>

<p>For a day or two he will be kept on “landing”
practice, and then he will be allowed to try for the
Royal Aero Club aeroplane certificate. The tests
and conditions for this are as follows: The candidate
must be over eighteen years of age, and of
British nationality; he must accomplish the three
following tests, each being a separate flight—</p>

<p><i>A and B.</i>—Two distance flights, consisting of
at least five kilometres (three miles, 185 yards)
each in a closed circuit.</p>

<p><i>C.</i>—One altitude flight, during which a height
of at least 100 metres (328 feet) above the point
of departure must be attained, the descent to be
made from that height with the motor cut off.
The landing must be made in view of the observers,
without re-starting the motor. The candidate
must be alone in the aircraft during the
three tests.</p>

<p>Starting from and alighting on the water is only
permitted in one of the tests, A and B. The
course on which the aviator accomplishes tests A
and B must be marked out by two posts or buoys,
situated not more than 500 metres (547 yards)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
apart. The turns round the posts or buoys must
be made alternately to the right and to the left, so
that the flight will consist of an uninterrupted
series of figures of 8.</p>

<p>The distance flown shall be reckoned as if in a
straight line between the two posts or buoys. The
alighting after the two distance flights in tests A
and B shall be made (<i>a</i>) by stopping the motor at
or before the moment of touching the ground or
water; (<i>b</i>) by bringing the aircraft to rest not
more than 50 metres (164 feet) from a point indicated
previously by the candidate.</p>

<p>The decision of the committee of the Royal
Aero Club in all matters connected with the test
is final, and without appeal.</p>

<p>The certificate itself, which is a handsome,
leather-bound affair, in the shape of a pocket-book,
can be obtained by sending along the certificate
of the flights accomplished, together with £1 1<i>s.</i>,
a photograph of the applicant, particulars as to
birth, etc., to the Secretary, Royal Aero Club, 166
Piccadilly, London, W.</p>

<p>His “ticket” having been obtained, the
“quirk”—who, incidentally, is now a “quirk”
no longer—is given a little more practice in flying
slow machines, in order to gain confidence, and is
then sent on to his first war station to learn to fly
the faster battle-planes and war machines, and at
the same time is confirmed in his rank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Even now his flying education is by no means
finished. After learning to fly the faster machines,
he will be put through a course of bomb-dropping.
After that a spell of cross-country work will occupy
his time; learning to fly from above by the
position of landmarks, roads, rivers, railways, etc.</p>

<p>After this he learns to steer a course by compass,
gets practice in machine-gun firing and dissembling
while in mid-air, and then he is ready at
last for the great adventure across the water. One
fine morning he will set out on a brand-new war-machine
for somewhere in the north of France.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>THE SPIRIT OF THE AIR</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The great war has brought in its trail horrors
innumerable, but, as if in compensation, has
brought to light all that is best in our men.</p>

<p>The heroism and courage of the airmen were
without precedent, but none the less admirable.
Those stripling pilots of the air that flew undaunted
over shell-fire in all weathers and at all
times have opened up a chapter in our history that
nothing can rival.</p>

<p>Who can define the psychology of these young
men who can meet death as an old acquaintance
and pass him, mocking, by—who laugh at fear,
and make a jest of danger? Is it that they are
without nerve entirely, or is it rather a pose, a
lovable bravado that hides their true feelings? Is
it that they are rather less devoid of fear than
their brothers in the trenches? Hardly. We have
known them, you and I, reader, in the last few
years, but under a different guise—as happy,
laughing schoolboys, as young men plunging into
life, the “flanneled fools and muddied oafs” of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Britain, and suddenly they have become men,
ready and eager to share a man’s burdens and
responsibilities, yet no whit altered; but deadly
in earnest when there is work to be done on the
other side.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the air does affect a man to a
degree, and endows him with that strange malady,
flying temperament, that makes him reckless, and,
to a certain extent, headstrong; occasionally to get
out of hand, and to find rules and discipline chafing
and irksome. But then the air has a call of
its own that few can resist; that runs through a
man’s veins like flame, and whispers courage and
defiance into his ear, that invites his sympathy, his
love, his esteem. But the air is a fickle mistress,
and woe betide he who dares to slight her or
make free at her expense; he must pay the penalty,
and that penalty is—death.</p>

<p>Every known sensation is experienced in flying:
joy—the joy of youth astride the dull old world,
accomplishing what previous generations dared
not to attempt; excitement, to feel the cool air
brushing one’s cheek, and whistling past one’s
ears; fear, danger, hope and despair; all are
crowded into this one brief hour of life.</p>

<p>Day after day, in all kinds of weather, the airman
must go up, for the battle seldom slackens
and never pauses on the earth beneath. One day
reconnoitering—that is, making a long flight over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the enemy’s country under a continual bombardment
from the Hun anti-aircraft guns, noting any
fresh movements of enemy troops, gun emplacements,
headquarters, supply depots, ammunition
columns, or any unusual activity on his roads or
railways. Another day taking part in a bombing
raid on some distant military center, or perhaps
out fighting enemy aircraft; but always taking
his life in his hands, and never knowing each
morning as he sets out whether he will return
again.</p>

<p>It is the proud and honest boast of the British
Air Services that they never advertise; and what
we lack in that respect, our enemy make up for.
We have our Immelmanns and our Boelkes, but
their identities are hidden under the simple pseudonyms
of Lieutenant X—— and Lieutenant
Y——. They perform their daring feats, not for
their own vainglory, not for the sake of decorations,
but from keen sense of duty, love of their
work, and for the further honor of the famous
corps of which they are units. It is this policy of
eternal silence that has so completely shattered the
moral of the German airmen in Flanders, and
driven them almost entirely from the air.</p>

<p>In many ways the air is own cousin to the sea,
for there is a chivalry of the sea which has been a
tradition for tens of centuries: a freemasonry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
good feeling and sportsmanship among those who
have their business in great waters.</p>

<p>The chivalry of the air is none the less real
because it has no traditions to fall back upon.
Nature herself has made the man of the sea and
the man of the air sportsmen alike; has given them
an instinct for “doing the right thing.”</p>

<p>The Air Service has, in addition, a quality exclusively
its own; I mean its youth. It is just like a
healthy schoolboy, intensely alive, active, happy-go-lucky,
yet ingenious enough where matters of
technic are concerned, and always eager to be out
for adventure.</p>

<p>But it is just these tremendous dangers which
are the breath of life to this splendid schoolboy
(even in age he is often little more). There is a
sporting touch in this ceaseless duel with fate, in
this juggling with life and death. That touch is
transmitted to the less figurative duels when there
is a tussle in mid-air with a flying Hun, when it
is his life or yours.</p>

<p>On second thought I withdraw that word Hun
in relation to the German airman; I continue to
apply it with all the vehemence I can muster to the
crews of a baby-killer Zeppelin, but one’s adversary
in Albatross or Halberstadt is an adversary
worthy of the name. Here, almost alone in all
phases of modern warfare, remains the personal
touch. Up there in the awful solitude of space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
two human beings pit their brains and courage one
against the other, with death each moment before
the eyes of both. It is a strange turn of things
that the latest development of modern science has
brought about a revival of medieval chivalry, the
single combat.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the freemasonry of the air.
Any airman who has seen any fighting could give
you countless instances of it. Your German airman
treats you as an honorable foe, and you treat
him as one. That constantly recurring phrase,
“An aeroplane was forced to descend and its two
occupants taken prisoners,” means that those prisoners,
whether Germans or English, were treated
honorably, even ceremoniously. A wounded aviator
landing in the enemy’s lines is lifted from his
seat with every care, and is almost invariably
saluted. I have known on five separate occasions
airmen fly over the enemy simply to drop the personal
belongings and effects of the men whom, in
a terrific mid-air struggle, they have succeeded in
sending crashing to earth and death. German airmen
have done the same, and seen to it that his
comrades should receive the cigarette case or
bundle of personal papers of a fallen foe.</p>

<p>One of the most dramatic incidents of this drab
war was the dropping of a wreath from an English
aeroplane in honor of the dead hero of the German
Air Service, Immelmann.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>An airman likes an opponent worthy of his
mettle; he likes even chances and the prospect of a
good fight. I shall always remember the disgust
at a certain war aerodrome recently. The approach
of a Zepp had been reported, and all was
excitement. Aeroplanes were dragged from their
hangars, and off they went at lightning speed.
Soon the return. Disgust was on every one’s face.
“We thought there was going to be some real
fun,” was the general grumble. “Zepp? Not a
bit of it; only a sausage balloon.”</p>

<p>Danger the airman shares with the soldier in
the trenches. Many a tale could be told of the
awful deaths, of roasting when the machine catches
fire, of hours of agony with a shattered leg or arm
when, at all costs, the machine must be piloted to
safety and a life (that of the observer) saved.
But such things are the lot of most men who fight.
It is the cheery sportsmanship, the good fellowship,
the national instinct to fight and behave like
a gentleman, that have become characteristics of
airmen of all nations, which I have tried to emphasize.</p>

<p>Such is “playing the game” in the Air Service.
Often it is a cheery life, but it is always a trying
one.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>SEAPLANES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The seaplane, as its name implies, is used solely
for flying over tracts of water. It is identical in
shape with the aeroplane, but with minor variations.
It is considerably heavier than the aeroplane
in weight, and is more of the formation of
the boat, though following the same “streamline”
principles as the aeroplane.</p>

<p>The engine-power varies from 70 to 150 horse-power,
but the machine is much slower in transit
and in climbing even than several of the lesser
horse-power land machines. The fuselage, or
body, is like a flat-bottomed boat, in the bows of
which are the engine and the propeller. Immediately
in the rear of the engine are the pilot’s and
observer’s seats, side by side, and not, as in the
aeroplane, the one behind the other. Again, in
place of the wheels of the landing chassis of the
aeroplane are two boat-shaped floats; these are
hollow in formation, very heavy, and extremely
fragile. When landing the seaplane on a rough
sea, the part of the machine most liable to break
up is the float.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>With regard to the actual flying of the craft,
where a mere touch of the control is capable of
maneuvering the aeroplane up from the ground, it
requires the grip of a Sandow’s developer to lift
a heavy seaplane off the surface of the sea. Similarly,
while maneuvering in the air, the movements
must always be of the gentlest nature, considerable
muscular force is required to bank
(turn) and climb the seaplane.</p>

<p>Landing is the most difficult and delicate maneuver
in flying; it is a tricky performance to land
an aeroplane, but it is doubly so to land a seaplane.
Should the surface of the sea be the least
bit choppy or rough, there is a grave risk of the
floats breaking open, and the machine turning
turtle, or diving down through the sea and precipitating
the pilot to a watery grave.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Work of the Seaplane</span></h3>

<p>The work of the seaplane may be placed in two
categories: first, work from the shore, when a
landing-station, bordering on the sea, is used as a
base; and, secondly, flying at sea, when the craft
is taken out on board a parent vessel, and flights
are commenced from the middle of the ocean.
With regard to the former, the work is for the
most part of a defensive nature, as that of driving
off invading enemy craft, and patroling the coasts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
for enemy submarines. The work at sea is principally
scouting for fleets, for a seaplane observer,
at an altitude of 5000 feet, has a range of view
ten times greater than the look-out man of any
battleship or cruiser.</p>

<p>In this latter case, flights are usually terminated
and commenced from the sea surface, alongside
the parent ship; and when the craft are no longer
in use they are lifted on board by means of a large
crane and stowed away on a specially constructed
deck.</p>

<p>From the point of view of interest, aeroplane
work is preferable to that of the seaplane. Nothing
more boring and dreary can be imagined than
a long flight over an interminable stretch of blue
water; the aeroplane pilot does, at least, have an
everchanging contour of hills and valleys, rivers
and woods, towns and villages beneath him,
whereas the seaplane man’s view is confined to
sea, sky and horizon, with perhaps an occasional
passing ship.</p>

<p>One seaplane pilot of my acquaintance, in order
to relieve the monotony, always took his dog, a
staid and wise-looking Scotch terrier, with him.
That dog can lay claim to holding the record
among dogs of the world, for he has now flown
considerably over 2000 miles. His method of
aviation is peculiarly his own, for, once the machine
has started and got under way, he curls himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
up in the body of the fuselage and goes into
a sound sleep, from which he does not wake until
the engine stops again.</p>

<p>Seaplane flying in these days is beset with dangers
of many kinds.</p>

<p>As an example, I will attempt to portray the
average day’s work of a seaplane pilot on active
service, somewhere in the North Sea.</p>

<p>A scene of unusual activity is revealed by the
breaking dawn, lat. “X,” long. “Y.” The sea is
calm, the rising sun giving it that peculiar grayish-green
tint, over which the early morning mist
hangs like a pall. Through the mist can be seen
the hazy, blurred outlines of the Fleet: squat,
lumpy monitors, slim and graceful cruisers, sharp-nosed
destroyers, submarines that hang, as it were,
on to the surface of the water. Great towering
battleships, dignified and stately, look down upon
the smaller fry with apparent disdain. Far in the
rear there is what at first appears to be an ordinary
smug-funneled tramp steamer; but a glimpse
of the huge crane and queer, elongated shapes
along her decks reveals the seaplane carrier.</p>

<p>Four o’clock in the morning. Though it is summer,
the weather is cold and raw, the chilly breeze
bites knife-like through one’s clothes, fingers are
all thumbs—rather a disillusion of the joys of flying.
The engine stops, and coughs and splutters
as if in protest at this extraordinary behavior.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Compass, maps, instruments are missing; the
petrol tanks are unfilled, or the oil has been forgotten.</p>

<p>At last, creaking and groaning, the crane is lowered,
and fixed to the craft. A few hoarse commands,
and she is swung off the deck and dropped
gently on to the sea, and off she goes, bound on a
reconnaissance trip or target-registering. First
taxi-ing far across the open sea, clear of the Fleet.
What a delightful sensation this is, skimming the
water like a seagull, dipping and bowing gracefully;
but it is quite another story when the sea is
rough, and the swell threatens every moment to
break up the floats and submerge the craft. At
last up into the air, 200, 300, 500, 1000 feet,
circling round the now, seemingly, stationary
Fleet; how still and quiet they appear down below
there!</p>

<p>The seaplane is usually a much slower craft to
climb than the aeroplane, and some time elapses
before a decent altitude is reached. The observer
busies himself plotting out the course, testing the
wireless gear, and preparing his report.</p>

<p>Scouting is the object of the flight, and scouting
implies, for the most part, keeping a weather eye
open for suspicious craft, enemy battleships,
cruisers, destroyers and enemy submarines, the latter
more easily distinguishable from a height,
when the bed of the sea in the more shallow portions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
can be read like an open book, sandbanks
standing out most prominently from the surrounding
azure blue.</p>

<p>Target-registering, on the other hand, consists
of following, or rather attempting to follow, a
damnably perverse raft, on which a large target is
lashed, at which the heavy guns of the Fleet are
firing from a distance of from fifteen to twenty
miles, and the observer wirelessing back the results
of their attempts, also entering the same in
his report.</p>

<p>To the uninitiated this report would at first
sight appear slightly less understandable than a
Chinese love letter or a Greek play. It is divided
into columns; first there is the time of the entry,
next the height at which the machine was flying,
the approximate position, and, last, the nature of
the observation. For example: 11.55 a.m. 6000
feet. Lat. 90, long. 70:6. Large two-funneled
steamers, apparently merchantmen, observed proceeding
in a south-westerly direction.</p>

<p>If the matter is of an urgent nature it is sent
back to the Fleet immediately by wireless, surely
the most valuable asset to aviation that exists, and
without which aerial scouting and reconnaissance
work would be almost useless. The apparatus is
light and extremely compact, consisting of one or
two Morse keys and an aerial. The range of action—that
is to say, the distance that a message<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
can be either sent or received—is not very great,
but such as it is, is invaluable. In a word, wireless
in the Navy is as near perfection as it is possible
for a new science to be.</p>

<p>The observer makes a sudden movement with
his hand in a south-westerly direction. Far down
on the distant horizon is the long black sleuth-like
form of an enemy destroyer. The wireless is soon
busy ticking the gladsome news to the Fleet, now
far in the rear. More and yet more black shapes
appear, and then our own destroyers come up,
dashing through the sea, at well over thirty knots
an hour, leaving a line of churning white foam in
their track. The enemy catch sight of them and
then turn north at full pelt, our own in hot pursuit,
until for fear of floating mines—it is a favorite
trick of the Hun sportsman, when pursued to drop
mines behind him, in the hope that they will strike
the enemy ships—our own destroyers come back
crestfallen and downhearted.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En passant</i> it may be said that a seaplane battle
is very similar to a fight between two aeroplanes,
though usually more slowly fought out, and hence
longer in duration. Such feats as “looping” or
sudden nose-dives are generally impossible.</p>

<p>The morning’s work is now completed, the
recall signal is received via the wireless, and the
great bird turns for home, not, however, without
sighting several merchantmen and something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
which appears to be the periscope of a German
submarine, but which, however, proves on closer
inspection to be floating wreckage.</p>

<p>The British Fleet comes nearer into view, first
the different shapes and sizes of the varying craft,
then the funnels, then the masts, the rigging and
the crew aboard. Throttling down his engine,
the pilot sinks gradually lower and lower, and
lands on the smooth surface of the water—strange
to say a more difficult and more tricky feat than
to come down on the solid earth for reasons too
numerous to mention in this short chapter.</p>

<p>Another long “taxi” across the water to the
side of the seaplane carrier, the creaking crane
comes sliding out again, is fixed to the craft, which
is hauled aboard, and stowed away until further
required.</p>

<p>“X or Y airships participated in the attack on
Great Britain last night; Z raiders were brought

the cold black and white of print, fail entirely to
bring to the reader’s mind a true sense of the danger
and the nerve-racking conditions under which
this novel form of warfare is fought out.</p>

<p>Let us imagine, if we can, the difficulties the
aeroplane pilot has to face. It is dark—pitch dark—sky
and earth are alike indistinguishable. Flying
at the best of times contains a more than comfortable
element of danger, and in the darkness
this danger is accentuated. The darkness deprives
the air pilot of all sense of direction and of locality,
greatly hampers him in the maneuvering of his
craft, and renders unpleasantly possible a collision
with another aeroplane on similar errand bent.</p>

<p>Starting out, there are a hundred and one small
details to be attended to, as the testing of the
engine, the trying of elevators and ailerons, and
the examination of the petrol and oil tanks, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
order to ascertain if there is a sufficiency of both
to last a two or three hour trip. All this to be
performed in the dark, with the engine screeching
loud, so that a man may not hear a word, and the
attendant mechanics indistinguishable in the
gloom.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the pilot, a small dry-cell electric
lighting set is installed in the body of every
machine, and by this means the pilot is able to
distinguish his instruments—a most necessary adjunct
to safe flying—the altimeter, which records
the height, “revmeter,” which indicates the speed
of the engine and the compass, more necessary
than any other instrument for night flying.</p>

<p>Getting off from the ground is by no means a
pleasant sensation. There are hangars, high
roofs, and chimney-stacks waiting to be collided
with, patches of thin and rarefied air, which will
bump the machine down as much as thirty feet at
a time; the ever present danger of engine failure,
necessitating a descent to the darkened earth beneath,
always so full of death-traps for the airman
and his craft.</p>

<p>Clear of the earth, at about 1000 feet, there
are, here and there, faint patches of light of dark
gray and the subdued reddish glow of the distant
metropolis; the locomotive of a passing passenger
train, bright as a searchlight for a brief moment,
then passing away into the outer darkness. Higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and yet higher; and the sensation! The mind of
a Jules Verne or of an H. G. Wells could not
imagine a feeling more eerie, more strange than
this. Noise and darkness, the incessant deafening
purr of the engine, the pitch blackness on all sides,
relieved by the one tiny light inside the fuselage,
as welcome and cheery to the airman as a distant
lighthouse to a sailor in a storm.</p>

<p>Then the searchlights begin to blaze, creeping
up across the sky in ribbons of shining brightness.
One plays for a moment on the machine, the pilot
is almost blinded before it passes on its strange
search across the heavens. But a stringent search
reveals—nothing! For an encounter with the
raiding airship is not at all probable at an altitude
of below 6000 ft., and from that height up to
15,000 ft.; the only likely encounter is with the
observation car of a Zepp. This car is usually
suspended hundreds of feet beneath the mother-craft
by means of a stout aluminum cable or
cables, is about 7 ft. by 5 ft., composed entirely of
aluminum, and contains sufficient space for one
observer, who is in telephonic communication with
the commander.</p>

<p>At last the pilot of the aeroplane has an instinctive
feeling that a Zeppelin is somewhere near
him. He cannot hear because of the noise of his
own engine, and he cannot see because of the intensity
of the darkness all around him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The combat between the aeroplane and the
Zeppelin might be compared to that between the
British destroyers and the German Dreadnoughts
in the recent Jutland battle. Dashing in with great
rapidity and skill, the tiny one-gunned aeroplane
fires its broadside, then makes off as fast as possible
to get out of range of the comparatively
heavy-armed airship. From thence onwards it
develops into a fight for the upper position, for
once above the Zeppelin the aeroplane pilot can
use his bombs, which are considerably more effective
than a machine-gun, and the broad back of
the gasbag offers a target which can hardly be
missed.</p>

<p>In maneuvering, the aeroplane has the great
advantage of being remarkably quick, both in
turning, climbing, and coming down, whereas the
Zeppelin again is a slow and clumsy beast at the
best of times. The Zeppelin is very susceptible to
flame and explosion of any kind; the gas in the envelope,
a mixture of hydrogen and air, forms an
extremely explosive mixture. The aeroplane, owing
to the fabric of which it is composed, and the
petrol needed for propulsion, is to a certain degree
inflammable, but not nearly to the same extent as
the airship. On the other hand, the airship possesses
a distinct advantage in that it is able to shut
off its engines, and to hover, which it is impossible
for an aeroplane to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, in the matter of speed in a forward direction,
and, for that matter, backwards also—for
the Zeppelin engines are reversible—the aeroplane
holds the palm with an average speed of
sixty miles per hour, while that of the airship is
only fifty.</p>

<p>The combat finished, the aeroplane pilot has
yet to make a landing, surely the most dangerous
and tricky maneuver of the whole flight. The
difficulties and dangers thus encountered are too
obvious to need explanation further than to say
that the landing has to be effected in the dark, with
only a blinding, dazzling, electric ground-light for
guidance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>THE COMPLETE AIRMAN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The British Air Service is now a great army,
80 per cent. of whom, before the war, had never
even seen an aeroplane, much less been up in one,—bank
clerks, young merchants, undergrads,
doctors, lawyers, journalists, all endowed with two
sterling qualities required by the pilot of the air,
courage and level-headedness. And how has this
great miracle been accomplished? August 1914,
found us lamentably short of both <em>personnel</em> and
material, but what little there was of the very
best. The already experienced pilots set to work
with a will upon the more than generous quantity
of raw material that came to hand. Within a few
months their influence made itself felt. They
taught the “quirk”—the airman’s pet name for
the novice—in their own simple and undemonstrative
manner, that the air is to be respected, but
never feared, the aeroplane treated as a being of
life and animation, with quaint humors peculiarly
its own, and not as a lifeless mass of metal and
woodwork. Within six months the number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
fully trained British pilots had trebled itself; within
one year the number had grown beyond all proportion,
and still it goes on.</p>

<p>The usual method of training a new hand is to
get him used to the air, which, though apparently
harmless and void, is as tricky and treacherous as
the sea. The beginner is taken up for several
flights as a passenger. In the initial flight the
pilot will perform the most daring maneuvers and
precipitate turns, watching his passenger closely
the whole time for any signs of nervousness or
fear. It is a most trying ordeal that first trip up
aloft, and the bravest hearts have been known to
quail.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">First Flight Ordeals</span></h3>

<p>Recently there was a case at a large school of a
Major of marines, concerning whose courage there
could be not the slightest doubt, and who possessed,
among other decorations, the much coveted
D.S.O. After a first trip above, the Major remained
in his seat of the landed aeroplane for
fully a quarter of an hour, ashen of countenance,
and too terrified to speak. It was not cowardice,
but simply that he was temperamentally unsuited.
At length, when he had composed himself sufficiently
to clamber out, he vowed that never again
would he go up in an aeroplane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Following the first flights there are numerous
trips in dual-control machines, that is to say, with
the ordinary pilot’s control-stick and steering-bar
duplicated, and both couples working under the
same control. Thus, gradually, the “quirk” becomes
used to the handling of the craft and accustomed
to the sudden drop in an air bank, or
to an outward slip in a gust of wind, until eventually,
without his knowledge, the instructor allows
him to fly the machine himself.</p>

<p>Sufficient progress made, he is allowed to make
flights alone, and when he has learnt to bank left
and right, and land the machine in a safe and
seemly manner, permission is given him to attempt
the Royal Aero Club’s certificate; for which an
altitude flight, a distance flight, and a landing on
a given spot are the only tests that are necessary.
This, let it be said, is but the starting-point of
the flying education. Flying fast machines, wireless
operating, machine-gun firing, bomb-dropping,
navigation and map-reading are still to be mastered.
Only one who has been in the air and seen
that queer panorama of jumbled green, gray and
blue, stretching away for miles on either hand behind
him, can appreciate the difficulties of an air
pilot endeavoring to make a true course from a
mist-bound earth; or when one’s hands are frozen
to the bone, and the ice-cold wind whistles by one’s
ears, the extreme difficulty of maneuvering the control-stick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and working the machine-gun at one and
the same time.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Reconnaissance and Night Flying</span></h3>

<p>This much for daylight flying, but what of the
night when sky and earth are alike indistinguishable?
Truly night flying is a science unto itself
which needs more than the average amount of
courage. However, nightwork is given to only
the most experienced pilots.</p>

<p>With active service flying again, we enter into
a new phase of which reconnaissance work occupies
at least eighty per cent. of the time. Simply
put, reconnaissance means flying over the other
fellow’s lines to see what he is about, if he is
massing troops at a certain point, or digging in
new gun emplacements, or if there is any unusual
activity on the highways and railways immediately
behind his firing line. It is a difficult matter to differentiate
between infantry and cavalry on the
march; to distinguish a cleverly hidden gun emplacement,
or to tell the difference between an ammunition
and a supply depot.</p>

<p>Bomb-dropping is a practice that requires the
patience of a Job, good judgment, and a calm day—that
is, if it is required to attain any degree of
accuracy. Last, but not least, there is the matter
of aerial combat, which, however, covers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
too wide a field for discussion in this short
chapter.</p>

<p>Thus, in the complete air-pilot, we have a blend
of gunner, wireless expert, map-reader, amateur
detective, and aviator.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>BEHIND THE FIRING LINE</small></h2>


<p class="right"><i>Somewhere in France,<br />
Friday.</i></p>

<p>Tucked away in a corner of an unused Flanders
roadway, a long straggled line of irregular
shaped huts and sheds surrounding a wide open
meadow land, several acres in extent, is the aerodrome
I have in mind.</p>

<p>On either side are the long gaunt avenues of
trees and in rear of them, bare and low-lying
arable lands.</p>

<p>No one can claim for it that it is a beauty spot.
But it is comfortable, and above all one is able to
obtain a bath there.</p>

<p>On the right are the officers’ quarters: three
long, low, wooden huts. Within, a passage runs
along the center of the hut; and on either side of
it are the various cabins, each about six feet
square, and providing just sufficient space for a
camp-bed, washstand and chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>A stove is at either end for warming purposes;
and one bath is allotted to each hut.</p>

<p>The mess-room is contained in a similar building
across the way. The furniture is not such that
one would meet with, say at the Ritz or the Savoy;
but it serves its purpose. Three plain deal tables,
each covered with a spotless cloth. A dozen or so
stiff-back wooden chairs, and one solitary easy-chair.
The competition for the latter is enormous.</p>

<p>The general atmosphere of the place is cheery
to a degree. Every member of the mess is full of
good humor, quips and jests. Sub chaffs captain
and captain chaffs sub, the while they attack plain
wholesome fare with an unstinted vigor.</p>

<p>After dinner in the evening, an impromptu concert
is started. One, an obliging musician, renders
an excellent violin solo. He is followed by a
gentleman of poor voice. The station orchestra,
in which the penny tin whistle is the most prominent
instrument, plays delightfully and harmoniously
with the possible exception of one member
in the extreme rear, who, having previously had
some bread-crumbs gently deposited down his neck
by an admiring colleague, finds some difficulty in
reaching the correct notes. It is, of course, the
star-turn of the evening.</p>

<p>There are good card-games to be had, when off
duty. Also a gramophone and two pianos. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
gramophone usually will not work. Ludo is the
rage to-day. Badminton, writing letters home, and
visiting the neighboring town about complete the
leisure time. There is, however, really not very
much to do in the town, except to sit in the cafés,
drink bad coffee, and try to talk French to the
girls.</p>

<p>Any number and variety of pets and mascots are
there. Cats and kittens, dogs of all breeds. A
few hunters, with which some excellent rides across
the sand-dunes can be obtained. A goat that
wanders around the aerodrome risking life a dozen
times daily from aeroplanes getting off and landing.
And a parrot with a perfectly wonderful
vocabulary of oaths.</p>

<p>Thus far we have been shown only the lighter
side of the life. Now we come to the more serious
work of flying across the lines. The strain on the
nerves is so great that a pilot is only detailed for
duty every other day. The work is distributed
among the various squadrons and flights. One is
responsible for reconnaissance work; a morning
and an afternoon patrol along the coast for submarines,
or a trip inland to have a look at a new
gun emplacement, or to report on a new movement
of the enemy’s troops. Another, the fighting
squadron, is responsible for the bombing raids, for
the battle flights, for convoying the reconnaissance
machines, and for meeting enemy air attacks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>To the headquarters flight is allotted the photography,
and any special and confidential job
that may crop up.</p>

<p>Naturally there is the pick of all the machines,
equipped with all the latest improvements and
inventions.</p>

<p>One peculiarity concerning atmospheric conditions
on the other side is, that either the weather
is too misty for flying, or on the other hand, it is
so remarkably clear, that it is possible to view the
land from twice the altitude that it would be under
similar circumstances in England. For the first
two hours after sunrise there is invariably a heavy
ground mist, and very little takes place save when
an expedition is setting out for some distant spot,
necessitating an early start. The late morning and
the late afternoon are the most favorable times
for flying purposes.</p>

<p>Almost the whole of the Flanders country is
intersected by waterways and canals. This is of
extreme value to the air pilot, and aids him greatly
in the matter of navigation. Railway systems there
are in plenty, mostly following an east or west
direction.</p>

<p>The junctions of these railway lines are the
nerve centers of the German Army in the field;
they control entirely the supplies of reinforcements,
ammunition, and supplies to the firing line.
It is for this reason that so many of our own air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
raids have been made on Bruges, Courtrai, Roubaix,
Lille, Tournai, and Douai. Each of these
towns mentioned contains an important railway
junction.</p>

<p>The large majority of the Belgian towns in the
enemy country, immediately behind the firing line,
have been totally deserted by their inhabitants and
the soldiers alike; it is not considered either safe
or desirable to remain within the area of a conspicuous
landmark, of which the enemy artillery
can obtain an exact bearing with the utmost ease.
Added to this, frequent allied air-raids, and the
accurate firing of the Allied artillery have reduced
them to untenable masses of fallen masonry.</p>

<p>A point regarding aerial photography is worthy
of note; if the surface of the earth has been disturbed
in any way within two days previous to
the photo being taken, that is, disturbed by the
explosion of a shell, or a new path across a field
made by the tramp of many feet, such disturbance
will always show up prominently on the camera
negative.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>THE FIRST TRIP ACROSS THE LINE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="right"><i>Somewhere in France,<br />
Monday.</i></p>

<p>A most important entry in my little diary, this,
the day of my first trip across the “lines.”</p>

<p>And here in the privacy of my thoughts and of
my pen let it be said that at first I was troubled
with qualms of fear—qualms that I had experienced
in the previous life after a stormy Channel
crossing, or prior to a visit to my dentist.</p>

<p>As I stood there on the dreary, wind-swept aerodrome
in the chilly rays of the early morning sun,
forebodings filled my mind. Visions of an awful
death in mid-air, and a yet more awful vision of
a downward rush of thousands of feet to the
ground below. Comforting myself with the reflections
that, after all, out of the large number
of machines that must daily cross the lines the proportion
of those reported missing was extremely
small, I was roused from my pessimistic thoughts
by the voice of the pilot, who was already in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
seat enjoying the luxury of the last few puffs at his
“gasper” (cigarette) before testing the engine.</p>

<p>He invited me cordially to “hop in,” and once
in to strap myself in securely. With his calm
matter-of-fact air, which, incidentally cheered me
up considerably, one would have thought that we
were about to start for a motor run through Piccadilly
and the Park rather than, as he so picturesquely
styled it, “to play the part of a clay pigeon
atop of a firework show.”</p>

<p>Three heavy-eyed mechanics now appeared upon
the scene, and, after having been slanged roundly
for their late arrival by our cheery Jehu, the engine
was started with an alarming whirr. A few
preliminaries and she got well away.</p>

<p>For a few moments we circled round the neighborhood
of the aerodrome, to gain height. Then
in the first contact with the icy-cold morning
breeze I felt thankful that I had taken the sound
advice of clothing myself well. I must have
looked for all the world like an Eskimo or an
Arctic explorer in my wool-lined leather coat and
overall trousers, a knitted Balaclava hat or helmet,
and over that again a skull-cap, the whole
tied down tightly beneath my chin. A huge woolen
muffler round my neck and a pair of unsightly
goggles completed the picture. I had treated my
hands and face with a generous dose of vaseline,
which I had been assured would keep out the cold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and which advice I now gratefully acknowledge
to be correct.</p>

<p>As we mount higher my perspective extends,
and out of the gray mists and the dark shadows
land and sea begin to assume their natural form
and color. On the former there are now signs of
movement; along the roads crawl the ant-like procession
of ammunition columns back from their
nightly trip to the firing lines. A steaming “Puffing
Billy” slowly drags along on a limber, a
“grandmother” (naval 15-inch gun) blocking up
the whole roadway, which must cause considerable
annoyance to the long string of cars and motorbike
dispatch riders held up in the rear.</p>

<p>On the roadside, by a wood, a company of
infantry are falling in for early parade; they look
up at us in a half interested sort of way. Some
wave their hats and rifles at us. I wave my hand
in reply, but know they cannot see us. We keep
on climbing steadily. Out at sea are two French
torpedo-boats making up the coast towards ——, and
a few small trawlers sailing off in the direction
of England. Happy thought!</p>

<p>Every moment we are getting nearer to the
dreaded area. In the far distance I can see the red
flashes of the rifles, the smoke clouds of the
heavy guns, and the long gray lines of winding
trenches. I look at my map, to discover that we
are passing over a junction of two main roads, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of which is crossed by a railway, while beneath
the other runs a narrow stream. It is ——.</p>

<p>Five miles to the firing line. With my glasses
I can already pick out several of our own field-artillery
emplacements, and a moving up of reinforcements
from the rear—I would surmise about
two battalions of infantry. I time the observation
on my report sheet; also I discover from my wrist
compass—my most prized and valued possession—that
we are going too much to the north-west
and tell the pilot so by means of a written message.</p>

<p>Course changed! What are Headquarters orders
for the flight? A reconnaissance over ——,
I puzzle out as well as my now fevered brain will
allow me, whether reconnaissance will be tactical
or strategical, and again whether “line” or “area.”
For the benefit of those who may perhaps read my
diary I will here endeavor to explain the fine
points which divide the two. The former reconnaissance
necessitates flying and observing along a
line between two given points on the map, these
points having already been marked in before leaving
the ground. Area reconnaissance, on the
other hand, comprises observation of a whole
area or district. To do this successfully it is
necessary to fly backward and forward several
times, thus adding greater risk to the adventure,
and taking a great deal longer time to accomplish.
Hence they are not undertaken very far away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
from our own lines, and then only if particular information
is required.</p>

<p>Thus far the weather had rendered the trip
ideal. But it would be an entirely different matter,
I surmised, when we came within reach of the
enemy anti-aircraft guns. Already they were getting
uncomfortably near. Should we have an easy
passage across or should we have to climb up for
our lives above the bursting “Archies”?</p>

<p>We were not left long in doubt. Their men
must have been up particularly early that morning,
for the very first shot came within an ace of
blighting two young and promising careers.
There was a loud report on the ground below,
the familiar “sing” of an approaching shell, which
at first interests one, but which in the course of
time one gets to dread. Then it seemed for the
moment that the whole machine had been blown
to atoms. But no! We started to climb hurriedly.</p>

<p>“High explosive,” the pilot bawled in my ear.
“Going up higher.”</p>

<p>For the next three minutes my feelings were
the reverse of pleasant, and I fervently hoped that
other observers did not suffer in the same way.
Shells burst above, below, to the right, to the left,
and all round us; but never near enough to do us
any serious harm, though the bullets of one shrapnel
shell certainly did rattle against the wings,
piercing them with minute holes in several places,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and I felt very thankful for the uncomfortable
sandbag on which I sat, which protected me from
bursting shells beneath.</p>

<p>As we climbed to a higher altitude the Huns
ceased their attentions, and we very soon arrived
over the scene of our “line.” My bad attack of
“cold feet” now having passed over, I set myself
to think seriously upon the precepts drummed into
my thick head by the instructor at the training
school. “The observer” he was wont to say,
“should always try to keep in touch with the military
situation, and particularly in the encounter
battle, and discover the disposition of our own
troops.”</p>

<p>One point I could and did satisfy myself upon—this
was no encounter battle. So I ignored our
own forces and kept my attention fixed upon ——.
Nothing extraordinary met my eye. I saw a camp
here and there, and turned my glasses upon them
and discovered that they were composed of huts.
Hurriedly I counted them, and noted the number
in my report, together with the altitude, 12,000
ft. Again the solemn advice of my worthy instructor
passed through my brain: “The eyes
must constantly turn to each likely spot, and each
spot must be examined carefully with the glasses
if it offers anything useful for the observer’s report.”</p>

<p>I examined each likely spot, and discovered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
my delight a broad grass meadow across which
ran several pathways of very recent construction.
Footpaths, I argued to myself (and I may possibly
have been wrong) are not made across fields
for the mere pleasure of constructing them. There
is more in this than meets the eye. I signaled to
my companion and he quickly grasped the situation,
and in long sweeping circles, brought her
down some 2000 ft. The lower we came the
more distinctly I could make out that some sort
of emplacement was being built up—the new emplacement
for a 17-inch howitzer. I noted the
same.</p>

<p>An excellent morning’s work. We turn to go
home. But the enemy has not appreciated our
attentions and most unthoughtfully turns his guns
upon us.</p>

<p>Then the fun begins. It was bad enough crossing
the lines, but child’s-play when compared with
this; and besides we are two thousand lower. A
perfect inferno of “Archies.” We bank first to
one side then to the other; put her nose down for
a moment or so, then climb for all we are worth.</p>

<p>But it is no good. We are hit!</p>

<p>Down goes her nose, down and down. The air
whistles past our ears. The earth rushes up to
meet us. The discs of the machine-gun topple
overboard, so steep has the angle become. —— must
have been hit. Yes! there he is, all huddled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
up over the joy-stick (control-stick). I give up
all hope, when suddenly, the machine starts to
right herself. I look around, and find that the
rush through the air must have brought him to.
He is manfully straining every nerve to get her
out of the nose-dive. By a superhuman effort he
succeeds. We manage to get across the lines unnoticed
save by a few infantrymen, who fire
futilely at us, and land a bare hundred yards the
other side of our own trenches. —— makes a
beautiful landing, pulls her up dead, and promptly
faints in his seat. My first trip!</p>

<p>“The life of an airman is one of intense idleness
interrupted by moments of violent fear.”
This remark, originating as it does from a youthful
member of the Senior Service describes, more
aptly than any other yet penned, the life of the
airman under active service conditions. Sometimes
there will come a spell of fine weather, and
he is kept going hard at it from sunrise to sunset.
At other times when the weather is too bad for
flying, he has nought else to do but sit round the
mess-fire and tell stories.</p>

<p>The memory of those wet days! Men of all
sorts and conditions exchanging personal experiences:
anecdotes of hair-raising escapes from
bursting shrapnel shells, thrilling fights with Air
Huns, miraculous evolutions in mid-air, and a
thousand and one other subjects dear to the heart
of the airman. I will here endeavor to relate
several of the best stories that have so far come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
my way, but it is impossible to tell more than five
per cent. of them, for their name is Legion.</p>

<p>The first story concerns a well-known aerodrome
somewhere in Flanders. The pilots of the
station, when the weather was too bad for flying,
filled up their spare time by playing football; until
one day a wag amongst them suggested that a ball
should be blown up as tight as possible; taken up
in an aeroplane and dropped on the German lines.
This suggestion was duly carried out and the first
fine day the ball was put aboard a machine going
up the Belgian Coast for a reconnaissance trip.
Arrived over the town that had been decided upon,
it was dropped overboard, with quite accurate aim
into the market square. Seeing this dark awesome
object falling through the air and taking it for a
bomb the Germans took to their heels. Landing
on the cobbled pave, it must have bounced nearly
twenty feet into the air, then gradually lower and
lower, until at last it rolled into a ditch. Then
and only then did the Germans reappear, one fat
soldier going over to it and giving it a vicious kick.</p>

<p>An instance of air <em>camaraderie</em> was that of the
Bosche who brought Pégoud down after a fight in
mid-air. Hearing that he had been killed, and
where he was to be buried, he came over and
dropped a wreath on the scene of his burial
ground—a pretty compliment that was greatly
appreciated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>The story concerning Captain M—— is the
most striking of the war. Poor fellow, he has
since been killed. It happened one very misty
morning. M—— was on a reconnaissance trip.
His engine failed and had to come down a good
ten miles behind their lines. However, he landed
safely, and had just burnt his machine, when he
saw three dark figures coming up out of the fog,
and taking discretion to be the better part of valor
he fled, and hid himself in a ditch hard by. He
was there for the whole of a day and a night, and
it has since been ascertained that there were close
on five thousand Bosches searching for him the
whole time. When he found the coast was clear,
he crept out of the ditch, and marched off boldly
down the road until he met a friendly Belgian
peasant; from this chap he wheedled an old suit
of clothes, and, thus attired, walked on nearly to
Lille. Here he acted somewhat foolishly. He
boarded a tramcar bound for the city, not knowing
where to ask to be put down. The car was
full of Prussian officers. The man came for his
fare; and for a moment he was nonplussed.
Then he had a brain-wave. Remembering that
every town in Belgium possesses a glorified market
square, he demanded <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la grande place, s’il
vous plait</i>, and pulled out a handful of silver coins
to pay the man. Such a thing as a silver coin
had not been seen in Lille for months, ever since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the Germans had captured it in fact. Fortunately
the Prussians were too much occupied in their
own conversation to take any notice of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ein
schweinhund</i> of a Belgian peasant. Arrived in
the city, luck again favored him, and he obtained
shelter in a garret for three weeks. Then the
police grew suspicious, and late one night he was
forced to clear out hurriedly. After leaving the
city he had a terrible time. He tramped right
across Belgium, always at night, and every moment
in fear of his life, feeding on anything he
could find, crusts and offal thrown to the pigs,
and stale bread thrown away by the German
soldiers. Footsore, weary, hungry and exhausted
he at last arrived at the Dutch frontier. Here
occurred another agonizing wait. Again for a
day and a night he lay hidden in a ditch, until
late that evening the sentry paused on his beat to
light his pipe. This was his opportunity. It was
a moonlight night. He dashed across the intervening
space. The sentry fired three shots and
missed each time. He got across Holland, to a
seaport town, stowed himself aboard a fishing
smack, got to England and reported himself to
the astonished officials at the War Office.</p>

<p>This reminds me of a story told by a certain
famous airman, a little man with a great heart, on
whose breast there are the flaring crimson of the
French Légion d’Honneur and the crimson and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
blue of the Distinguished Service Order. I will
give you his own words. “I went over the lines
with X—— for an observer. He’d never been
over the lines before and I must confess that I
felt a wee bit shaky as to how he would take it.
Luckily we got across without a single shot being
fired at us—and then we met a Taube, coming
right down wind at about ninety miles, and at
about our own level. I looked at X——, who for
a time, was too busy watching the other chap coming
up to notice me, but finally he turned and
smiled, and I knew he was all right. ‘Got the
Lewis-gun ready?’ I bawled into his ear. He
nodded, and then we cleared the decks for action,
so to speak. He put a fresh tray of ammunition
on the gun, and got two other trays ready by the
side of him, while I had a look at the bombs and
grenades, and put the joy-stick about a bit just to
see that she was all right. The other chap still
kept on, and was only about a hundred yards off
when X—— opened fire, zipp-zipp-zipp-zipp,
seventy-eight of the little beggars slick into the
middle of him. Gave him hell, I can tell you; at
all events he didn’t stick it long. Down went the
nose of his machine, and he was very soon about
a thousand feet beneath us. I loosed off all my
bombs, quick as I could, missed every time, had
a shot with a grenade and missed again. I must
confess I felt a wee bit flurried that morning—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
then X—— began. Never laughed so much in
all my life. He laid his hands on everything, his
hat and his glasses—Government glasses, by the
way—and his revolver and spare cartridges.
Thank God! There was nothing of mine in the
front there.”</p>

<p>Not nearly so pleasant, however, was the experience
of a certain seaplane pilot, who when
flying across the Channel from Belgium to England
was forced by engine trouble to come down
on to the sea, in the midst of our own mine-fields,
very far removed from the track of all shipping.
Here he remained for eleven and a half hours,
until sighted by a torpedo-boat, which though unable
to reach him herself, was able to give warning
ashore, so that a small motor-boat succeeded
in finding a way through the mines, rescued the
pilot, but was forced to abandon the machine.</p>

<p>Another story concerning Pégoud. The Germans
brought Pégoud down, when flying one of
the new French machines, that are supposed to
have so many wonderful new improvements
aboard, and that they’re so secretive about. He
didn’t have time to burn it—and the Huns were
very keen on learning how the thing flew. So they
tackled Pégoud on the subject. He said he was
perfectly willing to give them an exhibition himself,
but they didn’t care for the idea. “Yes, and
when you get up there you’ll fly away back to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
own lines again.” “Very well,” he said; “send
two of your men up with revolvers and let them
sit one on each side of me, so that I won’t be able
to get away.” To this they afterwards agreed,
and the first fine morning Pégoud, with the two
men sitting on each side of the fuselage, goes up
about 10,000 feet. Then one of the Huns began
to get impatient. Said he: “I think we’d better
go down now.” “That’s all right,” Pégoud answered,
“you’re going.” And with that he put his
joy-stick down. She went over a good clean loop,
and the Bosches went down quicker than they
bargained for.</p>

<small>SPORT EXTRAORDINARY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="right"><i>Somewhere in the North of France,<br />
Monday.</i></p>

<p>There is an undoubted fascination in being
about at sunrise on a clear, fine morning. And
especially so when up in the air.</p>

<p>Our day was of this variety. A day when a
man’s heart yearns for a moor, a dog, and a gun.
For moor we had the long, flat, dreary sandhill
and marshes of the Belgian coast; a dog was not
needed, and in fact would have been in the way.</p>

<p>And our gun was not of a type particularly well-known
or approved of in sporting circles—a
“Lewis” machine-gun, fitted above with a tray of
forty-seven cartridges.</p>

<p>Our quest was “wild ducks,” an idea as novel
as it was entertaining, originating with the padre
of the station—a cheery individual, who divided
his attention between writing insufferably bad
verse, and collecting mess-subscriptions from irritated
members.</p>

<p>The sun rose over the sea, lighting the blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
surface with a thousand scintillating rays. The
tents of the camps thousands of feet below began
to show up against the gray of the earth, and the
red flashes of the rifle volleys combined with the
white cloud and roar of the belching heavy-gun
to complete our picture of the waking world.</p>

<p>But we had not much time to pay attention to
these matters, for our minds and eyes were concentrated
on the one subject.</p>

<p>From what direction would they first appear?
Would they come up to us, or would we have to
put “her” down to them? The sun was well up
in the sky, and signs of life and movement were
beginning to make themselves manifest “down
there,” before several tiny black specks appeared
on the horizon coming up from the ground behind
the marshes at Nieuport.</p>

<p>We brought the aeroplane round, to get the
birds between the sun and ourselves, and with the
wind at their backs, so as not to be aware of our
approach. However, they turned off seawards,
and again we had to change our course, until they
seemed to be at too great a distance for us ever
to get them within gun range. The noise of the
racing engine must have reached them on this new
tack, for we were now only half-head on to the
wind; but of this they took not the slightest notice,
keeping on their way a regular and well-ordered
flock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>As a matter of fact this could be explained by
the reason that birds in that neighborhood must
have become so entirely used to the whirr of a
passing aeroplane, for as many as a score passed
over this same district every fine day.</p>

<p>We now changed our tactics, and brought her
round with the sun at our backs, casting a shadow
across the path of the moving flock, and a small
dull replica which moved in an alarming and
amazing manner across field and hedge, house and
farm, beneath.</p>

<p>At last we were getting up with them, and to
signalize the happy event the padre let off a dozen
rounds, which went very far wide of the mark, and
only served to divide the flock into two portions,
the larger of which continued in a seaward direction.</p>

<p>These we determined to follow, and coming
down to 500 feet, opened the engine “full out” to
close on 100 miles an hour.</p>

<p>Never before had one realized the wonderful
speed which these birds can keep up when on the
wing. For with all our great speed we were yet
far behind, and every moment drawing nearer to
the sea, across which at this extremely low altitude
we dare not venture.</p>

<p>Thus it seemed as if we should have to return,
defeated and discomforted, to a scoffing, chaffing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
audience on the aerodrome, still visible some five
miles to the south-east.</p>

<p>However, immediately before reaching the seashore
our quarry turned again, and this time along
the coast. Then, banking her over to the new
direction, we found ourselves “down-wind” with
an additional speed at the back of us of 15 m.p.h.,
which soon began to tell. The padre began to get
unduly excited, and succeeded in giving a not unmusical
series of “zimms” on the gun; the cartridges
falling spent and useless on to the sand-dunes;
there were no casualties. Undaunted, we
kept on, taking care this time to get nearer up.
The enemy were beginning to tire by this time, so
putting in a fresh tray of ammunition, our courageous
marksman let fly, with excellent results, three
of the rearguard speeding headlong down to the
earth. The pangs of a not unnatural hunger now
beginning to make themselves evident, and finding
ourselves some thirty miles from home, we turned
her head for home and there eventually arrived,
happy and hungry, after having set a new fashion
in sporting and aviation circles, and discovered
a new form of amusement and speculation for
the <em>blasé</em> ones, who had deserted their card-tables
and cheap French novelettes to welcome us on our
return.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>A BALLOON-TRIP BY NIGHT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Imagine a great bare meadow-land, lonely,
wind-swept, and dark with inky blackness, out of
which there plunges an occasional hurrying figure,
that misses one by inches and passes on with a
muttered oath. In the background, tall and sinister,
two large gasometers. In the center of the
field a wide tarpaulin laid along the ground, and
edged by a circle of sand-bags, from the midst of
which there rises a great round shape, like a mammoth
tomato.</p>

<p>It is the balloon not yet fully inflated, fed by two
curling rubber tubes, that disappear in the direction
of the gasworks. We are waiting, waiting patiently
until she fills. Blackened, distorted shapes,
that stand around in eerie circle, and at the sudden
gruff command of a hoarse voice that booms ever
and anon out of the voids of darkness, seize each
a heavy sandbag and slowly and clumsily lower it
mesh by mesh in the netting that covers the
balloon.</p>

<p>At last she is filled. The car is attached below,
as rapidly and securely as the faint and flickering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
light of a stable lamp will allow of. The crew
tumble in, one on top of another. She is let up
only to be pulled down again with a nerve-racking
bump. The gruff voice decides that she is now
ready to get off; there is a slight slackening of
ropes, an almost imperceptible lift, the figures on
the ground recede rapidly, grotesque shadows in
the darkness, and the lights begin to disappear one
by one.</p>

<p>We rise to a ticklish situation; there are tall
trees, factory-chimneys, and protruding roofs all
waiting calm and invisible in the night, to be
crashed into and collided with. But all these
obstacles we may miss if we have only sufficient
preparatory lift. We are all silent and cowed,
trying to make out each other’s faces. There is
a sudden tearing sound. The craft lurches like a
drunken man and we are thrown a struggling
breathless mass into a corner. But the suspense is
only momentary. By a miracle of grace, she frees
herself from the branches of a tree, and soars
rapidly heavenwards.</p>

<p>Eagerly we watch the glimmering, winding
streak of gray that is the river, and our only
visible landmark; apparently we are making off in
a north and west direction. Once out of the
shelter of the houses and the trees, the breeze is
stiffish: in fact, considerably more so than was expected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>What is this sensation like? Dark to the left
of us, dark to the right of us, dark on top of us,
and darker below us; in a frail uncontrollable
craft, that drifts aimlessly and helplessly before
every varying wind of the heavens. Unlike the
aeroplane the passage is easy and pleasant, free
from noise and we know we are flying. North and
west, but the first change of the wind, and we
will be bowling along merrily in quite another
direction.</p>

<p>It is quiet, intensely quiet, no motion of any
kind to be felt. But where are we? Occasionally
we discover a small patch of light that may be a
village, again a larger patch, evidently of a town.
We watch the altimeter with as much loving care,
as a mother would her child, for it is our sole
deliverer from destruction. How it varies: now
it is 8000 feet, now 2500. If possible, we try to
keep above the latter level. The surface of the
country is unfortunately not too level, and as the
altimeter registers height above sea and not land
level, allowance must be made. Ballast is ready
to hand for emergency uses.</p>

<p>At last the depressing silence is broken; one
youth, wiser than his years, has remembered to
provide himself with food. It is handed round,
and over beef sandwiches we get communicative.
It gives us fresh life and inspires one of the party
with a humorous turn of mind, to recite with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
vividness and vivacity all the alarming accidents
that have befallen night-balloonists, concluding
with an impious hope, “that we likewise may have
some fun.”</p>

<p>We get it!</p>

<p>Happily, as we are wallowing in the throes of
this most dismal expectancy, the conversation is
turned by an eager and heated discussion between
two younger members of the party, as to the merits
and demerits of their respective musical-comedy
idols (female). The argument grows in intensity.
But we have neglected to watch the altimeter. Out
of the inky darkness below there rushes a volcano
of spark and flame. It is a railway-train speeding
on through the night. Sheepishly we discover that
we are only 800 feet, and wonder unpleasantly
what might have been.</p>

<p>On and on through the night. Now we are
getting tired; there are suggestions that we should
land, but they are overruled. Coming down again
to 800 feet, we catch sight of a wide glimmering
sheet of water. Maps are seized in a hasty impulse
to guess our whereabouts. The argument grows
heated, for similar stretches of water there are,
alike in Essex, Kent, Surrey, Middlesex and Berkshire:
in fact, in every one of the Home Counties,
and for the matter of that in the Midlands, and
likewise in every county in England, Scotland, Ireland
and Wales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The argument abates, our eyes grow weary and
more weary. It seems a life-time since we last
saw the pleasant and undulating lines of the earth.
One or two heads are already nodding, when there
is a sudden shout of “the dawn.” Instantly all
are wide awake. There sure enough, are the first
few streaks of gray creeping slowly across the eastern
sky; without even that, it would be an obvious
matter, by reason of that intense cold, which, in
the air, always precedes the hour of daybreak and
freezes us to the bone.</p>

<p>It would be an inadequate expression to say that
dawn in the air is beautiful. It is more than
beautiful, it is wonderful. It is more than wonderful,
it is unusual; a view only to be enjoyed
by the minority, and that of the smallest. Gradually
earth and sky begin to dissemble. In tint the
picture is white, black, gray, blue, crimson, golden,
purple, green and every other color—now like
a painter’s canvas smudged with regular irregularities,
edged with red and gray, now an animated
panorama stirring with resuscitated life. The sun
rises, a ball of flame above the horizon, lighting up
the rotund shape of the balloon with an unearthly
hue.</p>

<p>We say nothing, but look and marvel; a word
would be out of place in this sacred and awesome
stillness. Suddenly we are roused by a cry, more,
much more, alarming than the last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The sea! We are almost on top of it. In
shimmering, level surface it stretches on into obscurity.
We are lost. We cannot avoid it, yet
less can we land thereon. One of the crew loses
his head. He snatches the thin red tape that hangs
down from the envelope. There is a tearing,
rending sound.</p>

<p>He has ripped the balloon at 2000 feet. Pious
prayers and curses intermingle. Down she sinks,
with a great hole rent in her side—down and
down, faster and faster. Over go the bags of ballast,
one after another. Now all have been
dropped. She slackens speed; but only momentarily.
Down she goes again, the upward current of
air whistles unpleasantly through the rigging. In
a last feverish effort boots are unlaced and hurled
overboard, together with coats and every portable
object to hand.</p>

<p>Too late. We hit the edge of a cliff; bounce
back several feet into the air, then sink down on to
the beach below. Another crash, again we are
bundled and bounced about in the confined space
of the car. The sand gets in our ears and eyes
and mouths. The balloon lies along the sand a
woebegotten shape, as flat as a pancake. When
we eventually sort ourselves out, we find luckily,
that there is but one casualty: a broken wrist, sustained
by the foolish idiot that ripped! Just
retribution!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>And to end the adventure, a stolid British policeman,
ponderous official-looking note-book in
hand, approaches and demands our names and addresses,
and asks if we are of British nationality!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>THE BATTLE OF THE WOOD</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="right"><i>Flanders,<br />
Wednesday.</i></p>

<p>Somewhere in the north of France there is a
little wood. It is about half a mile square in area,
and stands immediately south of a fine, broad
highroad, along which there daily pass large bodies
of reinforcements, infantry and cavalry, and
convoys bringing up ammunition and supplies.
The tall trees offer a welcome shade in the hot
weather, and it was the custom for passing troops
to halt there for a short time; and just at the spot
the roadside was always well littered with broken
bottles. Needless to state, it was in German
territory.</p>

<p>However, had it not been for that road, and for
the fact that on this certain day, when the road
had been closed to all traffic, there were certain
mysterious movements of ponderous great wagons,
suspiciously like ammunition wagons, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
halted in the shade of the wood, this story would
never have been written.</p>

<p>The day was hot, and the work was heavy, and
<i>mein herr captain</i> paused for a moment to curse
his uncongenial task, and take a long draught from
his water bottle, of some liquor that certainly was
not water. In the midst thereof he let it fall
with a curse of rage and surprise, for there overhead,
as if it had suddenly appeared from the
clouds, was the form of a British aeroplane.
“Himmel,” he exclaimed, “all our trouble wasted,
they have our hiding spot discovered, and to-morrow
morning they bomb us—ach!”</p>

<p>The worthy gentleman was not far out in his
deduction, for the lynx-eye of the observer in the
aeroplane had carefully noted the exact geographical
position of that new ammunition park, before
the machine sped off homewards. But he was
wrong to a certain extent; our Flying Corps are
no fools, and they realized that Mr. Bosche would
soon expect a return visit, and would be fully prepared
therefor. This course was, therefore, useless
to them; it was essential that that ammunition
park must be destroyed, but in a manner and at a
time the Germans least expected, and this is how
it was accomplished.</p>

<p>Towards evening a light scouting machine sped
swiftly away from a certain British aerodrome,
only a few miles behind the firing lines. No untoward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
incident that, but it was particularly conspicuous
from the fact that the entire aerodrome
had turned out to wish the trip God-speed, to wish
the pilot, a young second Lieutenant of the Canadian
Infantry, the best of luck, and to cram the
fuselage of the machine with spare ammunition,
until she could barely “stagger” off the ground.
The objective was the ammunition park already
mentioned. With long, sweeping circles the scout
soon cleared the area of the firing lines, and arrived
over the wood.</p>

<p>Still nothing happened, the whole countryside
was remarkably quiet for a battle area. No anti-aircraft
guns fired, no enemy aircraft came humming
round. Lower came the pilot to investigate.
Still nothing happened; he, on his part, now began
to feel genuinely alarmed, unless of course that
confounded observer had been “seeing” things,
a not unknown failing with aeroplane observers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the midst of the wood, the corpulent
captain watched the small speck carefully
with his glasses, then rubbed his fat hands with
glee and expectation. The fool Englishman was
falling beautifully into his little trap. Involuntarily
he glanced over his shoulder, and there in
a large clearing behind the wood, were ten great
German battle-planes, all ready to go up at a
moment’s notice and with pilots and observers
standing by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time the British machine had come
considerably lower, and was well behind the wood,
and into the German country. The captain gave
a sharp, guttural order. Immediately the noise
of ten great propellers smote the still air, and the
squadron rose swiftly from the wood like a covey
of wild ducks. The hated Englishman was hopelessly
trapped.</p>

<p>And what of our man? Turning leisurely to
make a last reconnaissance of the wood, he found
ten great German battle-planes between himself
and the lines. He cursed profusely at his own
crass stupidity. He had been warned, and he had
thought fit to ignore the warning, and this was the
result. Anyway he would make a good fight for
it. He fingered his machine-gun cautiously. Yes,
everything was ready to hand. He set his teeth,
opened his engine “full out” and began to climb
rapidly.</p>

<p>The Germans also climbed, and within a very
short space of time he found himself hemmed in
on all sides, with lead flying at him from all points,
and at all angles. Anyhow, he determined to have
a good run for his life, and singling out two Germans
immediately beneath him, he dived rapidly.
As he did so, he was hit by shrapnel; for a short
space of time he was unconscious, then again regaining
control of his machine, began to use his
machine-gun to good effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>First one German he drove to the ground, then
another, and then a third. His blood was up now,
and he turned round for further victims, but the
Huns had had sufficient for one day, and were
scuttling off to peace and safety. He turned
homewards, and his wound was becoming agonizing,
as a bombing squadron of our own machines
passed by.</p>

<p>Very soon there arose from the wood violent
explosions and blinding sheets of flame, and by
the time the British bombing squadron had finished
its full design, all that remained of the fat
captain’s ammunition park were a few broken and
shattered wagons, and a heap of dead and dying
men.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>A TIGHT CORNER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="right"><i>Somewhere in France,<br />
Friday.</i></p>

<p>The other day, yesterday afternoon to be exact,
a most exciting adventure befell me. I was detailed
to take part in a bombing raid at ——. We
had not proceeded far beyond our own lines,
after the customary bombardment of anti-aircraft
shells, when suddenly the machine immediately in
front of us rocked violently, and began to dive
towards the earth. “B——’s been hit,” my observer
bawled into my ear. I continued to watch the
machine in its headlong descent. Alas, it was only
too true! There was no possible escape: after
diving steeply six hundred feet, the machine had
begun to spin, and was now whirling round and
round like a humming-top, and hardly a minute
after, had crashed into the midst of a wood, from
which there immediately came up a cloud of gray
smoke and a leaping tongue of flame.</p>

<p>We had started out four strong; our mission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
being to raid M——, a large German military
center, containing a staff headquarters, an ammunition
park, and a large aerodrome. And now our
machine was the sole survivor, two having been
shot down when crossing the lines. Alone and
single-handed, in a notoriously dangerous portion
of the enemy’s lines, every moment we were liable
to be fired at from all quarters, and attacked by
enemy aircraft.</p>

<p>I looked searchingly at my observer; it was his
first trip across the lines, and I had to admit to
myself that never before, in my six months of
flying at the front, had I been in such a deucedly
uncomfortable position. How would he take it?
I hesitated. Should we turn back to safety, or
should we continue on our way to what was almost
certain death? I glanced at his face, it was stern
and set, with the deliberation of the man who is
willing to risk everything. With his left hand
he patted and fondled the deadly machine-gun. I
determined to go on.</p>

<p>Then they opened fire on us again. Apparently
for the last few minutes they had all deserted their
guns and had been busy gaping at the remains of
poor B——’s machine; but now, flushed with their
recent success, they commenced to fire with demoniacal
fury. Shots burst behind, before, above,
below: one minute immediately over the nose, the
next immediately beneath the tail of the machine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
To avoid them we climbed, and dived, and banked
in all directions, until her old ribs began to groan
and creak from sheer exertion, and she threatened
every moment to fly asunder in mid-air. At last
we got clear of them, and sighted our objective,
just as the sun broke through the clouds, and
revealed to us a stretch of low, flat-lying country,
dotted here and there with villages and camps and
ammunition bases. M—— showed up easily, it
was a moderate-sized town of ant-like pigmy
dwellings, little white and gray patches in the brilliant
sunlight. A small winding river skirted the
town, looking for all the world against the dark
background like the vein in a man’s arm. North
and south ran the gleaming, glinting railway lines,
and a large road led up from the town to the firing
line. This road was now converged with traffic of
all descriptions. We dropped a bomb, but it was
very wide of the mark, and it served to draw the
enemy’s fire, which again broke out all round us
with renewed fury. M—— was better supplied
with anti-aircraft guns than any other position on
the German front. Higher and yet higher we
climbed until we were well above the clouds, and
the earth was almost hidden from our sight. By
this simple and expedient <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ruse de guerre</i> we might
be able to get over the city before the gunners
were aware of our existence. But alas for our
well laid plans! We had not gone far when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
encountered a great double-engined Albatross,
and there, with the white billowy clouds stretching
like waves of a gigantic sea in all directions, we
fought our battle of life and death. Fritz opened
the encounter by sweeping down upon us at top
speed, pouring out a steady stream of lead from
the machine-gun in the nose of his machine. To
avoid this we climbed rapidly, and he flashed by,
beneath us, at an alarming rate. We attempted to
bomb him, but it was futile, and the bomb fell
downwards to the earth below.</p>

<p>We turned as soon as were able, and waited for
the enemy to recommence the attack. He was all
out now, and putting on top speed bore down upon
us with the speed of an express train. Nearer and
yet nearer he drew. Thankfully I noticed that we
were both at the same altitude. When yet about
a quarter of a mile distant, his observer opened
fire, the bullets flying all around us in a leaden
stream, and still we did not reply. I looked at my
observer. He was bending over his gun, fumbling
about with some portion of the mechanism. There
was no need to ask what was the matter. Alas!
I knew too well. The gun had jammed. Now
followed a ticklish time for both of us, for without
the gun we were completely unarmed, and
Fritz was drawing nearer every second. Already
I could hear and feel his bullets singing past my
head, occasionally chipping portions of the machine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Now he was right level with us. What
were we to do? To remain in that same position
would mean certain death. If we climbed, he
would climb faster, and would almost immediately
be up with us again. There was only one thing to
be done—the unexpected! So putting her nose-down,
we dived towards the earth like a stone, and
had gone over a thousand feet before I could get
her level again. This maneuver so upset the calculations
of the enemy, that he was now about three-quarters
of a mile distant. This gave us precious
time to prepare again for the attack. The observer
was still working feverishly away, when we
commenced to climb. Fritz had already turned
and was coming down to meet us; but we had the
advantage this time of having the wind behind our
backs. If only that infernal gun were ready! Up
we climbed, and down came Fritz; all the faster
because he knew we were comparatively unarmed.
Now we were under half a mile distant, now only
a quarter, and now he had commenced to fire.
Would we never reply? At last! Brrr! Brrr!
Brrr! yapped the gun in our bows.</p>

<p>Fritz was so startled at this unexpected development
that for a moment he paused in his firing.
This was our opportunity; taking steady aim
J—— put the whole drum of 47 cartridges into
his back in three bursts. He staggered and reeled,
he was hit; I felt I wanted to cry out for sheer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
joy, but my throat was parched and dry. Oh! the
reaction after that dreadful ten minutes. But although
we had hit him, Fritz was yet by no means
out of running, that is if he elected to remain and
fight it out, which I doubted extremely; for the
Hun is ever super-courageous when he has an unarmed
and helpless foe to deal with. So throttling
her down I watched him anxiously. Turning to
the left he started off at top speed in the direction
of his own base. This I had expected, and off we
started in his trail with only another half-hour’s
petrol in our tanks. On and on he flew, over wood
and town, and we were close in the rear, both flying
at top speed. Every moment he was getting
lower. I knew only too well what that meant. He
was trying to lead us into a trap, where we would
make a set target for a ring of his anti-aircraft
guns. We must never let this happen or we should
be finished for a certainty. If we could only catch
up with him; but it was in vain we wished, for he
was yet a quarter of a mile ahead, when, as usual,
the unexpected happened. He had engine trouble.
Within five minutes we were almost on top of him.
He commenced to sink like a stone. Now was
our opportunity, an opportunity which our observer
was not slow to take advantage of. Right
into the middle of his back flew the steady stream
of bullets. Again he reeled, and this time there
was that peculiar fluttering of the wings, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
tells only too plainly that an aeroplane is “out of
control.” Like poor B—— he commenced to
whirl round like a humming-top, then with one
long last plunge he had crashed into one of his
own encampments, and all was over.</p>

<p>We were left to reach our own lines with twenty
minutes’ petrol remaining, and under a violent
bombardment of the enemy “Archies.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Again an interesting personal account, told in
the words of the pilot participating in a Zepp
Strafe:—</p>

<p>The orderly from the telephone room brought
the news. Zeppelins had been sighted at —— and
were proceeding in a northerly direction. This
meant that they would be overhead at any
moment.</p>

<p>A few sharp orders and the station began to
throb with life.</p>

<p>Mechanics hurried hither and thither, some to
the sheds to get out the machine, others to fetch
the bombs and a Véry’s pistol from the armory;
yet others to lay out the light flares across the
aerodrome in order that upon our return we might
perchance be able to define the right landing
ground.</p>

<p>Compasses, electric light torches and maps were
dragged hurriedly from their hiding-places in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
lockers. A general bearing was taken of the
enemy’s course, and we ran out on to the aerodrome,
where a searchlight had already begun to
work, sending long, scintillating beams of light
across the dark night sky, turning and twisting,
first in one quarter, then in another, covering the
heavens in the twinkling of an eye, but never disclosing
the true object of its search.</p>

<p>At last there is a shout from one of the men by
the light. He had discovered the whereabouts of
the Zeppelin. Yes! there she is! A long, gray,
cigar-shaped object far up in the clouds.</p>

<p>We hurried across to the machine, and while I
examined the bombs in the bomb-rack beneath the
fuselage (body), and attended to the fitting-in of
the Lewis-gun, the pilot tested the engine. And
before five minutes had elapsed since the first
alarm we were off the ground.</p>

<p>Who can well and truly describe the sensations
of night flying? Suddenly one is hurled from the
ground into an unbounded space of darkness at the
rate of fifty miles an hour. It is like jumping off
a cliff on a dark night and plunging on and on, one
knows not where. It is impossible to see beyond
one’s nose, and the only thing that seems real and
natural is the incessantly loud hum of the engine.
It is a by no means pleasant task.</p>

<p>Leaving the ground we miss a roof-top by
inches, and, feeling considerably shaken, climb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
rapidly. At first it is dark, pitch dark. We see
nothing, we know not where we are. One would
lose one’s reason were it not for the hum of the
racing engine.</p>

<p>At last there breaks through the long shadows
of darkness, beneath us, a long, narrow, winding
ribbon of shimmering gray. The young moon has
broken through the clouds and the reflection of its
light upon the water gives us the position of the
river. On either side or moving slowly along the
surface are small pin-pricks of colored lights; I
switch on my electric light in front of the observer’s
seat, glance at the altimeter, and discover
that we are already 500 feet up.</p>

<p>The glare of that light, feeble though it be when
contrasted with the black darkness of the atmosphere
around, has got into my eyes, and for a
moment or two I can distinguish absolutely nothing.
Then lights begin to make themselves visible.</p>

<p>The street lamps can easily be distinguished; as
being darkened at the top the light is concentrated
downwards in a circle onto the pavement beneath,
which serves the purpose of reflecting it heavenwards
and upwards. The main streets can be
picked out by the two parallel lines of colored
lights; the windows of shops, the lights of which
have been covered with red and green shades.</p>

<p>I have another look at the altimeter. Only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
thousand, but still climbing steadily. Into a dark
bare patch of land far below there comes rushing
a flaring, glaring gleam of light, followed by a
string of smaller lights. I puzzle out what this
strange apparition may be. It is a railway train.</p>

<p>As we mount yet higher we begin to lose all our
bearings, and all sight of the earth beneath. A
much more beautiful earth when compared with
the dull, prosaic everyday affair, looking for all
the world like a huge garden decorated with a
myriad of multi-colored lights. It is difficult to
realize that those few, straggling, irregular rows
of lamps encompass seven million living souls;
that there far below us sleepily blinking and
twinkling is the greatest city of the world.</p>

<p>The altimeter registers 5000 ft. Getting
nearer to the Zepp altitude, yet no sign! The
anxiety of waiting and suspense is becoming insufferable.
Nothing but the incessant throb of the
engine. But I have spoken too soon! Out of the
darkness and blackness there rushes past, with
the speed of an express train, a black unholy shape.</p>

<p>Suddenly there is the most violent cannonade;
a sure sign that the anti-aircraft gunners have
spotted their quarry. Searchlights from all directions
are in a second of time concentrated upon
ourselves, while they are endeavoring to get the
range. This latter, much to the disgust of the
pilot, who, blinded by the glare, banks too steeply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
just in time saves her from a nose-dive, and consigns
all anti-aircraft gunners to a certain well-known
locality possessed of a permanent and extremely
warm climate.</p>

<p>We are in luck’s way, however; for presently
the guns are all silenced. The searchlights go out
one by one. All becomes quiet and dark, dismally
dark. We cruise around for another ten minutes
or so, then descend cautiously and gradually.
With one eye glued to the altimeter, to make
certain of the height, I peer over the side with
the other to pick up the first sign of lights or
landmarks.</p>

<p>Eight thousand feet! Seven thousand feet!
Getting horribly cold! Six thousand! Five thousand!
Shall we never get down? Four thousand!
Three thousand! it seems like an age. Two thousand!
One thousand! Cautiously now or our
necks will be broken!</p>

<p>At last we are safe back on Mother Earth
again, and very thankfully seek the refuge of our
beds!</p>

<small>AN AIR FIGHT WITH A HUN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="right"><i>Somewhere in the North of France,<br />
Saturday.</i></p>

<p>To-day our special delight has been a bombardment
from enemy aeroplanes.</p>

<p>They came over about noon and roused the fearful
and subdued the proud while we were all at
lunch. They circled overhead for about five
minutes, dropped a dozen or so bombs, then
cleared off hurriedly before our own men had time
to get away.</p>

<p>One man here had a most ingenious “funkhole”
for aerial bombardment. He utilized a large stone
drain-pipe for this purpose, and it was his custom
when enemy aircraft were reported to be in sight
to crawl into this thing, take a book with him,
and calmly read until they had taken their departure.
He advertised this comic shelter one
day as:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A novel bijou residence, completely detached,
every convenience, within easy reach of the firing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
line. Bullets and bombs pass the door every few
moments.”</p></div>

<p>Figuratively speaking, our mission was target-registering.</p>

<p>But having previously heard that the “mother”
(naval 9:2-inch gun) with which we were to have
worked was incapacitated, and the afternoon being
fine and sunny, we determined to seek adventure
further afield, and turning her nose in a south-easterly
direction kept straight on.</p>

<p>“Am making for Dixmude to see if we can
raise a Hun or two.”</p>

<p>This latter by means of a note passed over my
shoulder by the pilot. And here let it be said that
a proper understanding between pilot and observer
is one of the essential features of war flying. What
the latter misses the former often picks up, for
when flying at high altitudes of over 10,000 feet,
field-glasses for observation purposes, with the
excessive vibration of the engine, are at first very
difficult to manipulate.</p>

<p>Our machine, one of the latest scouting types,
was a beauty. She climbed rapidly and had a fast
turn of speed through the air, concerning which
latter feature there always seems to exist in the
lay mind a deal of misapprehension, especially concerning
the possibilities and peculiarities of the
various types.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>The aeroplane is a most curious and difficult
machine to build up, because so many different
factors have to be taken into consideration in the
construction of it. If it be constructed for speed
work, it necessitates a large engine, and hence
more weight, and with its limited “lifting” capacity,
some other feature has to be sacrificed, very
probably petrol-tanks, thus cutting down the possible
duration of flight. Similarly speed would
have to be sacrificed for duration.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that an aeroplane can only
specialize in one feature and cannot possess, at
one and the same time, speed, lift, safety, climbing
power and long durability.</p>

<p>The alpha and omega of the adventure was that
we were within certain limits free to do what we
pleased. This added a certain amount of vim and
interest, especially so when compared with target-registering.</p>

<p>As we sail along the blue sky over green fields
and steepled city, my eye constantly roams round
in search of enemy aircraft, but thus far with not
much luck.</p>

<p>The firing lines are now far behind us, and we
are well over into the enemy’s country. One
would have thought that before now we should
have encountered a stray Aviatik or so, or a
patrolling Albatross.</p>

<p>At last! In the far distance and coming towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
us at a great speed “down-wind” is a white-nosed
machine, which I distinguished as “Fritz,”
a single tractor biplane, a hybrid of the Albatross
and Aviatik types, fitted with a 225 h.p. Mercedes
engine, that gives 90 miles per hour. It has a
range of ten hours’ flight, and carries two Maxim
guns—one in front, but only firing sideways, and
one behind the pilot.</p>

<p>Immediately thoughts of an aerial combat flash
across my mind. I had never taken part in one
before, but had often watched them from the comfortable
security of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra firma</i>: during that first
moment I had a bad attack of “cold feet.”</p>

<p>A vision of many a hard-fought battle in mid-air
came before my eyes. With the opposing
machines darting above and below one another
like two great birds, the sun glistening on the
whitened planes as they turned and twisted, while
all around and silhouetted against the deep blue
sky were the little black and flame patches of the
bursting shrapnel, it was a gloriously fascinating
sight.</p>

<p>The uncertainty held one spellbound. Suddenly
one of the machines would put down her nose and
descend like a stone to earth; for a moment one’s
heart was in one’s mouth until she would right
herself and climb up again into the fray. Sometimes
these wonderful battles would last as long
as forty minutes or an hour, until one or the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
would crash down thousands of feet to the earth
below.</p>

<p>In a warfare of long-ranging artillery, and the
scientific slaughter of an invisible foe many miles
away where hand-to-hand combat was practically
unknown, these duels in mid-air were a delight
to friend and foe alike, for they, and they alone,
were favored with the old-time romance of war,
daring and adventure.</p>

<p>Men in the trenches would leave their rifles,
forget the enemy, and gaze with wide-open eyes
at what was going on overhead; drivers of ammunition-wagons
would pause on their way in
the middle of the road craning their necks, the
while red-hatted staff-officers would order their
cars to be stopped until the fight was over.</p>

<p>Those two little black specks, suspended thousands
of feet above were the cynosure of all eyes,
and when the stricken machine came low enough
for her nationality to be distinguished, if it were
a black cross on either wing a shout of sheer joy
would burst forth from many an anxious heart;
if on the other hand, it were the three circles of
red, white, and blue, a sigh would go down the
lines like the rustle of the wind through the trees.</p>

<p>She is almost up to us by this time. I let fire
with the machine-gun, but she is still beyond
range. Oh, those moments of expectation!
Would she fight or turn tail and run?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>She elected to do the former and climbed quickly
above us. Her pilot opened fire with his machine-gun.
The bullets whizzed past our ears, dangerously
near.</p>

<p>We climb in turn and lose sight of her for a
moment or so. It is a complicated game of blind-man’s
buff. We got up with her at last and both
let off simultaneously. There is a language spoken
in that act, a language that has neither stops, commas,
letters, characters, notes, nor images. It is
the language of unbounded hate. Hate to the
death. We got above her and “down-wind” this
time. Luck is on our side. Another tray of cartridges
for the gun quickly! That’s got her. She
drops sharply. Her pilot must have been hit and
lost control of his “joy-stick.” We are right on
top of her now and let the whole tray of munitions
off into her back.</p>

<p>Suddenly down goes her nose. She rushes
earthwards with a very fair speed to waft her pilot
to paradise. Faster and faster she travels.
Fainter, fainter does our view of her become!</p>

<p>Down below the hundreds are waiting anxiously,
already glorying in the prize. She’s down at
last!</p>

<p>Most thankfully we turn home.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Somewhere in the North of France,<br />
Monday.</i></p>

<p>As I walked across the aerodrome, the feeble
rays of the young moon were dying in the west.
It was 4.30 in the morning, with an icy-cold nor’wester
shrieking through the tree-tops, and I was
very thankful that I had taken the precaution of
clothing myself warmly in a wool-lined leather
coat and trousers, a pair of long gum boots—invaluable
for keeping out wet and cold alike—a woolen
balaclava helmet under my leather aviation
cap, and two pairs of gloves to keep my hands
from freezing.</p>

<p>We had received our instructions the previous
night. Ten bomb-dropping aeroplanes were to be
convoyed by two battle-planes.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned that a bomb-dropping
machine is usually of the fast, scouting variety,
with a speed of well over ninety miles per hour,
and is a single seater—that is to say, it carries no
observer. The reason for this is not very far to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
seek. With two men and a machine-gun aboard,
very little power remains for a supply of bombs;
without an observer and a machine-gun, the bomb
supply may be doubled. And the more bombs
aboard the more damage can be done to the
enemy.</p>

<p>The battle-plane is either a “pusher” (with the
propeller at the rear) aeroplane, mounting a large
gun at the prow, or a Caudron with two engines.
Its principal duty is to protect the bomb-dropping
machine from attack by enemy aircraft.</p>

<p>The two battle-planes were the first to get away
from the ground and the others soon followed.
When they had all reached an altitude of 5000
feet, they took up their pre-arranged formation
with one of the battle-planes on either wing; then
turned their noses eastward towards the sun, and
set off in the direction of the enemy lines.</p>

<p>Far away across the sand-dunes there came the
first rays of the rising sun, casting a thousand
scintillating gleams across the sea. Out in the
channel was a fleet of fishing smacks, heedless of
the drifting mines, bowling along merrily before
the breeze to their accustomed fishing-ground.
The dull gray lines and the smoke-belching funnels
of a British destroyer, full out at thirty knots
showed as she churned the seas into masses of
white foam, leaving in her rear a long white wake.
Dotted here and there were small tramp-steamers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and cargo-boats. By the sand-dunes off the coast
was a long dark shape, which might easily have
been mistaken for a whale, had it not been for
that tell-tale periscope. It was one of our own
submarines. Away in the distance was a dark
irregular line, which later in the day and in a
stronger light, would reveal itself as the shores
of old England.</p>

<p>A glance at the altimeter—the instrument for
registering the height—revealed the fact that we
were now 6000 feet. Still climbing, the course
was set further out to sea, to avoid as much as
possible the anti-aircraft guns at Westende and
Middlekerke.</p>

<p>Things ashore now began to brighten up.
Along and behind the firing line there was the occasional
flash of a heavy gun, followed almost immediately
by dense clouds of white smoke. Along
the roads there crawled, ant-like, the long columns
of supply and ammunition wagons. Sometimes a
big gun appeared, hauled along by a puffing traction-engine;
sometimes a battalion or company of
infantry or a squadron of cavalry moving up to
the front line.</p>

<p>Running south and east were the two dull gray
straggling lines of opposing trenches, so close
together in places that they appeared to run into
one another. We were gradually drawing nearer
to those much dreaded lines where our real troubles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
were to begin. Already far up along the coast,
it was possible to distinguish Middlekerke and the
Ostend railway station.</p>

<p>The first anti-aircraft shot! A long-drawn-out
hiss and a violent explosion in unpleasant proximity—a
pretty enough exhibition to watch from the
safety of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra firma</i>, but deucedly uncomfortable
when one is playing the leading part in the little
drama. It is the first shot that is always the most
unpleasant and the most terrifying.</p>

<p>For the next few moments there continues a
fairly strenuous bombardment, which necessitates
rapid climbing and diving to continually alter the
range. Then the firing ceases for a short while,
and all is normal again.</p>

<p>From behind a small wood there comes floating
gayly up aloft the long and ugly shape of a
“sausage” (captive balloon). Now is our chance
for a little just retribution. But, apparently the
Germans have seen us, for the “sausage” is being
brought rapidly down towards the earth again.
The temptation is too strong for two of our men,
who, despite previous orders to the contrary, try
their ’prentice hand with a few bombs, without
success. It is easy to see that this is their first
time across, for the “sausage” is the most difficult
of all targets, and very rarely hit.</p>

<p>My map now reveals to me that we are over
Ostend. More shrapnel flies up, interspersed here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and there with high-explosive shell. One can feel
a certain contempt for shrapnel in mid-air. The
conditions are entirely different when firing across
the land, than when firing straight up into the air.
In the latter case the resistance is more than treble,
with the result that, by the time the shrapnel
reaches anything of an altitude, the best of its
driving force has been expended, and bullets rattle
harmlessly against the wings of the aeroplane. In
fact, on one occasion a Royal Flying Corps pilot
returned from a reconnaissance trip with 365
bullet-holes in various parts of his machine,
which was still air-worthy.</p>

<p>High explosive is another matter. If it bursts
reasonably near the machine, there is not the
slightest chance of ever reaching the ground again
in a whole condition, and even when bursting at a
distance it is apt to give the aeroplane a nasty jar
and sometimes upsets it entirely.</p>

<p>One machine has had to drop out and has turned
back towards the lines, and now there are only
eleven of us. More shrapnel and yet more; much
too near on the last occasion. We climb rapidly
higher to 10,000 feet. It is a fine, clear day, and
everything beneath us is quite distinct. Even so,
it is a very difficult matter to maneuver the
machine and to use one’s glasses at the same time.</p>

<p>One peculiarity in atmospherical conditions on
the Continent is that the weather is either too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
misty for flying, or so remarkably clear that the
airman can reconnoiter from much greater heights
than in England. For the first two hours after
sunrise there is invariably a heavy ground mist.
Yet early morning and later afternoon are the
more favorable times for flying purposes.</p>

<p>Ghistelles looms into view, far away to the
south and bathed in a sea of light mist. It is the
great German aeronautical center in Belgium. All
the large enemy raids are organized and planned
at this center. The town itself is of no great size,
but it has good lines of communication by road
and rail, both to the firing line and the distant
bases in the immediate neighborhood of Brussels.
There are some forty hangars there, and until
quite recently there were two large sheds. Probably
no other spot within the German lines is so
well and plentifully supplied with anti-aircraft
guns as is this place.</p>

<p>Far away in the distance, and coming “down
wind” at a very great pace, is a minute black
shape, at present no larger in size than a man’s
hand.</p>

<p>An enemy machine! Excitement rules high. He
cannot have seen us, for no Hun airman would
dream of taking on so many of our machines
single handed.</p>

<p>Nearer and yet nearer he draws. Suddenly he
sees us. He turns quickly, but is too late. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
battle-plane on the extreme right is after him.
The enemy skirts the fringe of the dark clouds
that hang across the horizon. After him goes our
battle-plane. For a short space of time both are
hidden in its depths. Then, from the distant end,
there descends rapidly a small black object.</p>

<p>Is it British or enemy? Down she goes; a steep
volplane turning into a spiral, and finally into a
murderous-looking nose-dive. Thank Heaven, it
is the enemy machine. I have seen the black cross
on the tail. Back comes our machine triumphant,
and we continue on our way to Ostend.</p>

<p>There are various objectives of an offensive
through the air. There is the attack on enemy
aircraft. This is hardly a matter for an organized
raid; it is rather the errand of a cruising battle-plane.
Next there comes the destruction of material;
ammunition columns (usually situated in
woods), parks of transport, railways, and all appertaining
to them, and especially bridges and
trains, stations and sidings, enemy headquarters,
aeroplane and airship sheds, petrol depots, and
gas-works.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is the bombing of troops. This is
a comparatively simple matter, the best occasion
on which to attack them being when they are
crowded in roadways and similar areas.</p>

<p>Zeebrugge was at last almost within reach. The
place is recognizable from the long jetty running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
in a large curve far out into the sea. Proceeding
in a westerly direction are numerous heavy troop-trains,
and standing in the sidings several locomotives
with steam up, all of which incidents point
to the movement of a large number of troops. In
the harbor are four destroyers and three submarines.
The more the merrier!</p>

<p>Gradually we draw nearer. It is now possible
to see something of the panic in the streets and
roadways. Motor-cars are darting out of the city
in all directions; the destroyers are hurriedly trying
to make for the open sea. The anti-aircraft
guns begin to open fire from every quarter. And
then we commence to drop our bombs. Down they
go, those ministers of death and destruction, to
their targets. Huge columns of living flame leap
up skywards hundreds of feet into the air. The
din of the engine resounds upon the ear-drums until
we begin to wonder if we shall ever be able to
hear distinctly again. But down below, where the
guns still pound away unceasingly, the crash of the
bursting shells, the violent explosions of the dropping
bombs; all are strangely noiseless. It is a
veritable inferno of death and destruction.</p>

<p>The roof-tops of the city are covered with great
rolling clouds of thick black smoke. It is now
almost impossible to distinguish any landmark on
the ground below.</p>

<p>Two of our machines have already gone crashing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
down. The sight of them falling is the greatest
shock to the nerves imaginable; it is the true
test of bravery, for one always feels tempted to
give up and follow them, but only for the passing
second. The lust of battle grows strong again;
more bombs and yet more are dropped onto the
stricken city. The flying of the machines is marvelous
to behold.</p>

<p>Another of our craft is hit, making number
three; she, too, disappears into the mist beneath.
Our bombs are now all exhausted and we turn
thankfully homewards. Another machine drops
out, to land safely on the foreshore, and, as we
afterwards learn, the pilot is made a prisoner.
Then we reach our own lines once more and are
safe.</p>

<small>A DAY-DREAM</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="right"><i>Somewhere in the North of France,<br />
Saturday.</i></p>

<p>The other day I had a dream; at six o’clock in
the morning, at 10,000 feet up in the air, with the
biting cold wind whistling by my ears. On all
sides stretched the air, a boundless infinity; beneath,
a moving panorama of wood, river, and
hill, of men, guns and battle-field. Far in the distance,
the waters of the North Sea glinted blue in
the early morning sun; when suddenly the air became
filled with a strange purring sound, and from
all sides came flying hundreds of aircraft of varying
shapes and sizes. Among them I noticed one,
a leviathan. A long cigar-shaped, silver-tinted,
super-airship; beneath and swinging easily in the
breeze, the hull was in the shape of the old-fashioned
sea-going steamer. For’ard was a wide expanse
of promenade deck, where could plainly be
distinguished the passengers walking to and fro.
In the center, on a raised dais, a band, resplendent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
in blue and gold, were strumming some popular
air. Amidships a great bridge, where the officer
of the watch and the quartermaster were directing
her course. Astern was another wide expanse of
deck, but this apparently was reserved for the
crew. Now a large group of men were busily engaged
round a small, bullet-shaped aeroplane.
With a whirr, she started off across the wide deck,
and a second later was gracefully clearing the great
ship’s side, and missing a green and white balloon
buoy literally by inches, sank rapidly in a southerly
direction; and then our wireless telephone rang.
It was the big ship speaking us, “Had we seen
anything of the home-bound mail?” “No, we had
not.” “Could we say what the Siberian weather
conditions had been the day previous?” “Well,
nothing extraordinary, slight haze over North
China.” “Strange, the Menelaus left Canton yesterday,
should have reported Bombay this morning,
Moscow reports her two hours overdue.”
“No, we have seen nothing of the missing liner;”
and, leaving the great pleasure ship miles in the
rear, we skim across the Carpathians, speaking
two Serbian cruisers on patrol duty along the
Northern Frontier. From thence we run into a
storm, have to climb to 5000, and by the time the
mist and darkness clears away, the North Sea has
loomed into view. Now we are more in the beaten
track, swarms of small pleasure craft go cruising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
by; the Paris-London way is chock-a-block with
traffic: cumbersome great four and eight engined
merchant vessels, slim graceful pleasure craft,
Government vessels, two giant American liners,
and an Australian non-stop mail-boat, some naval
craft and small police patrol craft, endeavoring to
order the converging lines, and two military transports
bringing home leave men from Abyssinia.
The Far East fleet, flying majestically and impressively
along with the flagship <i>Twentieth Century</i>
leading the line, the hind portion tapering off
gracefully and far into the rear to the smaller
aeroplane—torpedo craft. The air is full of the
crackling of the wireless, every master endeavoring
at the same time to engage a berth in either
the London or Norwich aerodromes. Soon the
fleet makes a sharp turn to the left, the less important
and smaller craft scurrying hurriedly away
to give her passage. The Home Fleet looms into
view, silent and majestic; in the dim distance the
two units sight each other, and after paying the
usual compliments, pass on their respective ways.
Nearer the English coast the air swarms with
pleasure vessels, elegant and tiny airships float
lazily in the air, their occupants lolling idly in the
sun. Over Dover can be seen the ugly form of the
new floating dock, said to be large enough to accommodate
even an air dreadnought.</p>

<p>Strung across the North Sea; about 2000 feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
up, and well below the level of the trade routes,
are the small gray ships of the Aerial Sporting
League. We speak one of them. There is to be
an international race this morning between London
and Petrograd. Amused, we watch the long
gray line at the starting-post, among the green
fields of Kent, presently they are beneath us in a
long extended line, two machines of our own red,
white and blue, well to the fore. We give our
number and business to the Patrol airship at the
Nore, and come down slowly to pick up our landing
stage, somewhere east of Greenwich, when
suddenly the waters of the Thames below are cleft
in twain, as if by an earthquake, and from the disturbance
there rises a squat, peculiarly shaped
craft, that commences to glide along the smooth
surface of the water towards Purfleet, where she
climbs gently out onto the far bank, into a wide
gray slipway, some quarter of a mile in width.
Still crawling along on her belly, she reaches the
Government repair works where, taking fresh supplies
aboard, she suddenly sprouts two wings and
commences climbing up into the air. Again there
is an unpleasant purring noise, and a yet more unpleasant
concussion....</p>

<p>“Shrapnel,” my observer bawls into my ear,
“better go higher,” and we do.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>A MID-AIR BATTLE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="right"><i>Somewhere in France,<br />
Friday.</i></p>

<p>It was a sleepy old-world town hidden away in
the sunny hills of Northern France, with a broad
highway leading from the town in either direction
and easily distinguishable from the air as being a
first-class or main road, by its extraordinary width
and the superabundance of traffic passing to and
fro. We were still flying low and could easily distinguish
the long strings of motor cars, convoys
of ambulance wagons, supply and ammunition columns.
In one place a battalion of reinforcements,
marching up towards the firing line with their
transport wagons in the rear. Further up and
nearer to the firing line were a string of motor
’buses, crowded outside with Tommies, their bayonets
gleaming silver as they caught the rays of
the early sun. In another place a small traction-engine
was hauling a chain of limbers, on which
were the parts of a “grandmother” (naval 15-inch
gun) being hurried up to take part in that murderous
duel along the lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>We are now getting nearer the dreaded area,
and for the sake of comfort and safety have to
climb higher. The surface of the earth, however,
still remains distinct. The long gray winding lines
of trenches stretch away to the north and south as
far as the eye can reach. In some places as much
as half a mile divides them, in others they are so
close together, that from above they appear to
“kiss.” But our happy soliloquizing is broken by
the burst of a shrapnel shell in the near vicinity.
No more time for thought now.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Soft Job</span></h3>

<p>Diving, climbing, banking, anywhere to get
away from those awful shells, and who can give
description to the dreadful sensations one undergoes
the first time under shrapnel fire in mid-air?
Heaven and earth seem to be rent in twain by
those murderous little balls of smoke and flame
and lead.</p>

<p>One’s past life rises before one’s eyes, sometimes
most unpleasantly. Shells burst all round, above,
below, to the left, to the right. At one moment
over the nose of the machine, the next beneath the
tail. Once hit, and the aeroplane and its occupants
will plunge down to an agonizing death on
the ground, many thousands of feet below.</p>

<p>“And this,” once remarked a cynic of one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
flying Services, “is what the men in the trenches
call a soft job.”</p>

<p>By the time we have the opportunity of looking
over the side again, we are well into the enemy’s
country. In appearance this is an almost absolute
replica of the area behind our own lines.
There are the reserve trenches; there the big-gun
emplacement and the advance hospitals, battalion,
brigade and divisional headquarters, and far, very
far, in the background, the German G. H. Q.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">An Enemy Machine</span></h3>

<p>We keep a wary eye open for movements of
troops or supplies, but there is nothing doing.
The enemy, like ourselves, is browsing on this
beautiful September morning. Again we are
troubled with the bursting “Archies,” and again
we climb higher, this time above the clouds, that
stretch all round and beneath us in a billowy snow-white
sea. Slowly we creep round a big white
fellow towards the sun, when out from a distant
corner, like a spider from his web, there darts an
enemy machine. Has he seen us? For a moment
he keeps on his way, then suddenly round goes his
nose, and he comes towards us “down-wind” at a
great pace. As he draws near we discover that
he is double-engined and mounts two machine-guns.
He has the advantage both in the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of guns and speed, which counts for a great deal
in an aerial combat. With a faster turn of speed
and the wind at his back, a good pilot should be
able to overcome an enemy machine, however
large and however heavily armed.</p>

<p>While still about five hundred yards away, he
opens fire, but without effect, his bullets fly wide
on either side of us. We reserve our fire. Now
he is almost on top of us, and in the upper berth,
thus having a great advantage. He is over us;
the great shadow of his machine comes between
the sun and ourselves. All the time his observer
is firing wildly, some of his shots have punctured
the wings, but thank God, none came near the
body. The danger is over. It has been a narrow
escape.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Carry On</span></h3>

<p>We climb as fast as possible, then turn to find
him coming to meet us, almost on end. Another
machine-gun duel between the observers. We have
got him this time; he is hit, he drops suddenly. A
few more shots from our gun and it will be all
over with him. But our gun has jammed, hastily
the observer tries to remedy it. It is too late.
We have missed our opportunity. Nothing else
for it but to put a new tray of ammunition in the
gun and have another go at him. How difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
this is in mid-air! In the safety of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra firma</i> it
is the easiest thing in the world to take the gun to
pieces, or to change the ammunition tray, but here,
in the confined space of an aeroplane up in mid-air
it is an entirely different matter. We are only just
ready when he turns to meet us. Another duel—he
has passed by.</p>

<p>Again we both wheel to the combat. This time
he is on top of us. We give up hope, and prepare
for the worst. On the top of us again; his shooting
is bad, but he has got the observer in the arm.
Turn round to escape—no combat possible with
the man at the gun <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i>; but the observer,
plucky fellow! does not know the meaning
of defeat. He signals to his pilot to carry on.
We turn again. The enemy is confident that he
has winged us. Too confident! We wait till he
is almost level with us before we fire. Then zipp,
zipp, zipp, he is hit. He plunges downward. We
get on top of him. Another round of lead into his
back. It is all over, he plunges headlong to earth;
and with a feeling of regret for our gallant foe,
who fought so well, we turn homewards to earth,
peace, and safety.</p>

<small>A BATTLE FROM ABOVE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="right"><i>Somewhere in the North of France,<br />
Thursday.</i></p>

<p>Dawn—not as we imagine it; but a dawn with
God’s clear Heaven filled with every winged messenger
of death. The very earth is shaken with
agony, and the face of the sun is blotted out by
heavy, choking clouds of picric smoke that hangs
and hovers over the earth like a pall.</p>

<p>Far in the background rises a battle aeroplane.
Nearer and nearer to the line it creeps, and without
any attention from the enemy’s anti-aircraft
guns. The German artillery is too much engaged
in work of a more serious nature—the work of
hurling back the irresistible lines of British infantry.</p>

<p>The frail craft passes over the lines, and meeting
with no opposition sinks lower in long, sweeping
circles, and finally appears to hover, as nearly
as an aeroplane can hover, some two miles to the
east and well over the enemy’s country. Then it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
bombarded on all sides with “Archibalds,” now
above, now below, now immediately in front, now
immediately behind, but the machine continues to
maneuver as if entirely oblivious of shell fire.
Other swiftly moving shapes have now crept out
from the direction of the British base, and all are
hovering over different portions of the long line
of muddy trenches, while the battle rages in all
its fury.</p>

<p>All the varied operations of the extensive battle-field
are as an open book to the watch in that frail
craft ... the battle swaying backward and forward
from trench to trench, the hand-to-hand combat
in the open, the ding-dong artillery duel, and
the hurried rush of supports and reinforcements.
Nothing can be hidden from this peering eye
above, that transmits the news by wireless to the
great guns far in the rear, and to the headquarters,
where the commander traces every movement of
the battle on his map, like a chess-player planning
his moves and counter-moves on a chessboard.</p>

<p>The enemy’s country is more heavily wooded
and more broken than our own. Dotted here and
there are small straggling villages. To the north,
on either side of the road, are two small villages,
now a mass of ruins. Between them is the tall
chimney of a sugar factory, from which the black
smoke no longer rises; and behind it, nearer the
firing line, the long, ragged arms of a windmill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
move furtively in the slight breeze. To the south,
and immediately in the rear of another small village,
there is a large and straggling cemetery.</p>

<p>Woods, farms, a broken and distorted railway
line, another factory, and a narrow winding
stream, and the picture is complete. No! Not
quite complete. Standing far removed from the
main road is a large and densely wooded forest.
The observer watches anxiously the stretch of
British trenches immediately facing the wood.
Then the barren, shell-swept land between the
opposing trenches springs into life. Men and
more men come swarming across the trenches and
make for the German lines.</p>

<p>The observer watches anxiously the stretch of
British trenches immediately facing the wood.
There is a strange, unaccountable feeling in the
air that, were it not for the never-ceasing roar of
the aeroplane engine, would be hushed and silent
as the moment prior to the start of a horse-race,
when an element of overstrung expectancy pervades
the human brain. Down below there, the
lilliputian figures crouch like ants behind the mudbank,
waiting for the dread signal when the race
shall commence, the race of human life and death.
The booming of the great guns in the rear has
long since ceased, and the nebulous region of No-man’s-land,
were it not for the battle-scarred
earth, would resemble an ordinary peaceful countryside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
so quiet and deserted has it become. The
minutes tick slowly on and on. Now it must be
getting very near the appointed hour. Will it
never come? Restless movements are evidenced
in the opposing trenches, where an occasional bayonet
glitters in the sun, or strange figures wander
to and fro. At last! With a shout and roar, they
are over the top. The earth trembles. Then the
barren shell-swept land between the opposing
trenches springs into life. Men and more men
come swarming across and make for the German
lines. The scene now baffles all description, it is
like a fleeting glimpse of Dante’s Inferno, as if
all the hate and murder and courage and strength
of human existence had met in one protracted
struggle of life and death between savagery and
civilization. The two opposing masses intermingle,
so that now it is no longer possible to distinguish
each from each.</p>

<p>At last there comes a lull in the battle, and the
aeroplane pilot, his hazardous expedition concluded
and at a sign from the observer, thankfully
turns for home, leaving behind him a scorched and
scarred earth from which the smoke rises continuously
in curling white-gray clouds.</p>

(BEING PART OF THE DIARY OF AN INHABITANT)</small></h2>

<p class="right"><i>Somewhere in Belgium,<br />
Sunday.</i></p>

<p>Sunday again, but hardly to be imagined in
these troublous times and places, with adventure
for one’s bedfellow, war for one’s profession, and
bloodshed and horrors for one’s constant reflection.
Despite all this there exists, and must always
exist in every war that peculiar intermingling, that
strange blend of horror and sentiment, hate and
romance, that mixture of dross and gold. The
feelings and actions that bring out all that is the
most savage, the most primitive in man’s nature,
at the same time endowing him with the tenderness
and unselfishness of a woman, the courage of
a hero, and the fortitude and forbearance of a
saint. Romance! I have a most charming instance
to give to you my dear M——.</p>

<p>We met him first in December, 1914, in the little
old-world town of S——. In fact I had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
good fortune to be billeted upon him. The better
class, or rather all those inhabitants who could
afford it, had fled from the town at the first advance
of the Hun hordes. But he had elected to
risk his neck, and stay to comfort, and if possible
to protect, the women and children. He was a
queer old character was Père Dreyfus; he had
lived in the little town now thirty years, since he
came there first as a stripling curate. His curling
brown hair had turned to an austere gray, his
cheeks were hollow and shrunken, and his old
back was bent almost double with shouldering
other people’s burdens. By the general population
he was almost idolized, men, women and even
small children brought their troubles to Père Dreyfus,
and they never went away without receiving
the closest attention, and the warmest sympathy.
As they loved and idolized him, so he reciprocated
their feelings, and never tired of talking of them,
in the long dark evenings, when we had the pleasure
of sharing his company over a glass of old
port, with Monsieur le Maire. He would relate
vividly and with force, how in the great advance,
the Uhlan patrols had ridden into the town,
camped there for thirty-six hours, then returned
the way they had come without, strange to say,
molesting any of the population. But there was
one thing that Père Dreyfus did not believe in,
and that was the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bah,” he was wont to say, with a contemptuous
snap of his bony fingers; “mere playthings,
toys, those air-machines, toys that will be shot
down before they have been in the air for half-an-hour
on end.” He had incidentally never seen
an aeroplane in flight, and little did he guess how
those mere playthings were to affect his own life.</p>

<p>The cold, dreary winter had blossomed forth
into glorious spring-tide, when again I came to
S——. The old town had not changed much; if
anything it was sleepier and drearier than ever.
My first visit was to the little corner house by the
great stone church; but the little corner house was
no more, in its place was a pile of shattered masonry.
With vague misgivings I sought M. le
Maire, and found him in his stuffy, dingy little
office in the Hôtel de Ville. He was poring over
some musty documents as I entered, but immediately
left them to shake me effusively by the hand.
“But where is Père Dreyfus?” I demanded of
him. Where? He gave that impressive shrug
of the shoulders peculiar to the Latin, and rolled
his eyes meaningly towards the heavens.</p>

<p>“Dead?” I exclaimed. “How did he die?”</p>

<p>“Ze airplanes,” he replied; “how you call them?
Ze flying machines come one night, and drop a
bomb. When I go search in ze morning, ze
worthy Father is no more.”</p>

<p>Thus briefly, in as many words he recounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
another tragedy of this awful war. Fortune is,
indeed, a fickle jade. It had been her will that....
But there, the story is best told in the worthy
Father’s own words. I quote extracts from a little
diary that it was his habit to keep, and which
was all that now remained to enable us to glean
a true glimpse of the old Father’s personal feelings
in the matter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Monday.</i>—The incessant thunder of heavy artillery
the whole night long. Thus it has been for
the past fourteen months, night after night without
a break. I notice it no longer; it has become part
and parcel of my everyday existence. Up at ——
yesterday those devils shot Meurice. For what
reason I have not yet heard. I wonder what has
become of his wife and two children? God help
them if they are in their hands! Yesterday as I
walked from —— I noticed high up in the sky
three black specks coming over in a north-easterly
direction. Our soldiers said they were German
aeroplanes, but they passed away again without
attempting to drop any bombs. It is not these
things that we fear, but those fiendish 17-inch
shells, which come over sometimes in the middle
of the night and tear away a street of houses,
killing, wounding, maiming. Unhappy Belgium.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>—No change! M. le Maire asked
me if I would billet two British soldiers to-day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
I found them pleasant fellows enough; young lieutenants
of an infantry regiment. Such youths, one
of them cannot be more than eighteen years of
age: a handsome boy, with the deep blue eyes and
fair curling hair, typical of his race. They appear
to regard the war more in the light of a big
picnic. But they have not yet been up to the
firing lines, nor seen the terrors of battle. Again
to-day two enemy air machines came over. They
hit Laroche’s wine store and killed him and his
wife and children. Nevertheless, I cannot help
thinking that they are but of minor importance
when compared with those diabolical shells.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>—The two soldiers left again this
afternoon, smiling and joking as they came. All
the afternoon and far into the night the infantry
have been marching past, along the road, thousands
of them, regiment after regiment, with their
bands playing gayly at their head. The men all
happy and contented, marching as if they were
going on parade, instead of up to the firing line,
many of them never to return. They have brave
hearts these English! Many wagons of ammunition
have been placed in the wood behind this
house. They call it an ammunition park. Why, I
know not.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>—All to-day it rained and thundered.
Thundered as if God in His Heaven were venting
His wrath on the warring world below. For one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
long day there has been no booming of those awful
guns. The road has become bare and deserted.
In the evening came men into my house from the
ammunition wagons in the wood. They told me
that they had caught a spy. I am not surprised;
this district swarms with them. But what otherwise
can be expected if, previous to the war, the
entire business relations of the neighborhood were
conducted with the Germans? Every purchasable
article from a motor-car to a needle was supplied
from Berlin. This man was discovered in a deserted
part of the wood, sending messages on a
telegraph key. A sapper of the engineers saw the
wire laid across the ground, and curious to know
whither it led followed it along until he discovered
this man. He will trouble us no more. But the
unhappy result of it is, they say he signaled the
position to the enemy, who will undoubtedly bombard
us when the weather becomes fine again.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>—A fine clear morning. I hoped that
the words of the sapper would prove themselves
to be incorrect, and so they were to a certain degree.
Anxiously I awaited the bombardment, and
it must be confessed with a great misgiving in my
heart. Ten o’clock! Eleven o’clock! Twelve
o’clock! And still they did not open fire. But
just before one a German Taube flew over. Unlike
the air machine in the previous visits it did not
fly away immediately, but came gradually lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
in long sweeping circles, until with my glasses I
was able to distinguish the two black crosses on
the wings. Then the pom-poms began to bark and
screech, and the heavens all round were marked
with small white clouds of smoke no bigger than a
man’s hand in size, and fascinating to watch. He
was a cool fellow, the pilot of that air machine:
undismayed by the bursting shrapnel he continued
to circle round overhead, as if taking the exact
bearings of the ammunition camp.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>—I was roused from my bed by a
series of violent explosions. It is that infernal
bombardment come at last, I thought to myself.
But no! The air above was filled with a loud hum
as of a hundred motors. I looked above me to
find the face of the sky darkened with aircraft,
all of them with the black cross on either wing;
from all sides they appeared to be circling in. And
every moment there would be the unpleasant rush
of the falling bomb. A shattering explosion. A
burst of flame! And the yell or cry of the dead
and dying, the heartbreaking neigh of a wounded
horse, the crash of falling timber. The series of
smaller explosions as the ammunition and cartridges
went off. For ten awful moments this continued,
bomb followed bomb, explosion followed
explosion, shrieks, cries, groans. It was a living
hell. My God, these aircraft are more to be feared
than those infernal guns. I—I——</p>

<small>HEROISM IN THE AIR</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Somebody censored was engaged in a long reconnaissance
trip into the enemy’s country, and had
already turned home when a shrapnel shell burst
immediately beneath his aeroplane, smashed part
of the body of the machine, and shattered the
pilot’s leg. Rendered unconscious, he lost control,
the aeroplane began to nose-dive to the earth, and
fell 5000 feet. From this point the observer takes
up the story:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have given up all hope, the earth seemed
rushing up to meet us, and I prayed that our agony
might not be prolonged. I shut my eyes and
waited for the final crash, when, wonder of wonders,
the machine began to right herself. Hardly
daring to believe my eyes, I looked to the pilot’s
seat. The headlong rush through the cool air
must have brought him round, and he was making
strenuous efforts to regain control.</p>

<p>“Luckily the enemy had given us up for lost,
had ceased to shoot, and we immediately began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
climb again. Then the Germans opened fire, and
we only escaped with our lives through the superb
pilotage of L——, with one leg shattered and
blood flowing in streams. At 8000 feet he again
seemed to be sinking. I hastily scrawled a note
urging him to descend. He read it, shook his head
decidedly, pointed to me with a smile on his white
drawn face, then pointed in the direction of our
lines, and carried on.</p>

<p>“At times he would faint, and then, recovering
himself, redouble his efforts. At last we were over
the lines, but it seemed utterly impossible that he
should be able to land the machine in his condition.
But he did. Choosing a large green meadow about
three miles behind the trenches, he landed as gently
and as easily as if he had only been up for a
practice flight, brought the machine to a stop, and
fainted dead away.”</p></div>

<p>This gallant pilot, as he lay mortally wounded
in the field hospital, and knowing that he was dying,
thought only of the terrible time his observer
must have had. Thus he wrote to his mother in
England:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mummy dear</span>,</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed at my little escapade;
will be all right again soon and be with you....
Poor P——, what an awful time he must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
had after I fainted and we were nose-diving headlong
for the ground!</p>

<p>“P. S.—Please don’t go talking about this business
to all the old dowagers of your acquaintance.”</p></div>

<p>Officer R—— M—— was on a bomb-dropping
and reconnaissance expedition in the neighborhood
of Y—— in the late summer of 1915. When
twenty miles from our lines he was hit by shrapnel
and mortally wounded in the thigh, but making up
his mind not to be taken prisoner, he kept bravely
on, crossed the lines, and disdaining to take advantage
of the cover thus afforded and land in the
first available spot, kept resolutely on to the aerodrome
from which he had set out, though losing
blood rapidly and knowing he had not long to live.
There he made a beautiful landing, handed in his
report, and fell unconscious, never to come round
again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Early in the present year an air raid was organized
to bomb a town not far from Constantinople.
The raid was duly carried out, but on the journey
home one of our aeroplanes was hit by a shell and
forced to come to earth in marsh lands beside a
small river. Immediately a party of Turkish infantry
rushed up to take charge of the craft, but
before they could reach it another of our machines
swooped down on the scene and landed close by.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
The pilot jumped out, ran across a field swept by
Turkish rifle fire, picked up the wounded pilot,
and placing him on his back, staggered across to
his own machine. Still subjected to a violent fusillade,
he unthrottled his engine, and with the
wounded man carried before him, bravely flew
off and made his own base again.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>THE EVOLUTION OF THE AIRSHIP</small></h2>


<p>The airship is the aristocrat of the air. In
jealousy and scorn the aeroplane may refer to her
as “gasbag,” “sausage”; may poke fun at her by
reason of her unwieldy size, and laugh at her lack
of speed; she still looks down on that craft with
as much haughty disdain as a duchess of royal
blood would bestow on a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nouveau riche</i>. Has
she not a pedigree as long as may be forgotten?</p>

<p>She may trace her genealogy back to the Greek
mythology and may number among her progenitors
such men as Leonardo da Vinci, Cyrano de
Bergerac, Francisco de Lana, Joseph Montgolfier,
Blanchard, Santos Dumont and Count Zeppelin.
The aeroplane is but an invention of the Twentieth
Century!</p>

<p>Italy was the birthplace of the lighter-than-air
craft; throughout the interesting history of the airship
the names of famous Italian scientists predominate,
and particularly those of the monastic
order. Perhaps it was that convent life was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
inducive to study; untrammeled by the cares of
the outside world, men turned their attention to
the sciences and developed their imaginations.
Be that as it may, we find that to-day the Italian
airships are the finest in the world.</p>

<p>But although Italy may have done more than
the other nations, history tells us that it was two
Frenchmen, Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, who
were the first to bring the lighter-than-air craft
prominently before the world.</p>

<p>The story goes that while rowing, Stephen’s silk
coat fell overboard into the water. It was placed
over a hot oven to dry, and watching it, Joseph
noticed that the hot air tended to make it rise.
The upshot of the affair was the Montgolfier
balloon.</p>

<p>Throughout history the lighter-than-air craft
has figured prominently in warfare. In the Franco-Prussian
War, during the siege of Paris alone,
as many as 66 balloons left the stricken city, carrying
60 pilots, 102 passengers, 409 carrier pigeons,
9 tons of letters and telegrams, and 6 dogs.</p>

<p>Gaston Tissandier went over the German lines
and dropped 10,000 copies of a proclamation
addressed to the soldiers, asking for peace, yet
declaring that France would fight to the bitter
end.</p>

<p>In the American Civil War an aeronaut named
La Fontaine went up in a balloon over an enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
camp, made his observation, rose higher into the
air, and succeeded in getting into a cross-current,
which carried him back to his place of departure.</p>

<p>The first cross-channel flight was made by
balloon in 1785, by Blanchard, who had with him
an American doctor named Jefferies, together with
a large supply of provisions, ballast and oars.
This weighed the balloon down to such an extent
that she almost sank into the sea a few moments
after starting. Ballast was thrown overboard, and
she rose, only to sink again. More ballast was
dropped. Then they rose into the air and eventually
landed in safety on the hills behind Calais.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having thus shortly outlined the development
of the one, we will endeavor to discover the fundamental
difference between aeroplane and airship.
It is simply the matter of “lift” obtained in the
case of the latter from the property of being
lighter than air, whereas the other craft being
heavier than air must obtain its “lift” by mechanical
propulsion.</p>

<p>The airship is merely an improvement on the
old-fashioned balloon: a balloon to which mechanical
propulsion has been applied. Different in
shape, indeed, and fitted out with many modern
improvements, its flight is still governed by the
same laws of “aerostatics.”</p>

<p>For practical purposes we will divide the airship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
into two portions: the envelope or balloon, and the
car. Atmospheric conditions influence the envelope
to no small degree. The effect of heat upon gas—with
which the envelope is filled—is to make it
expand, and consequently cause the craft to rise.
Cold, on the other hand, causes the gas to contract,
and the craft to descend. Air pressure is another
factor which must be taken into account, and this
is greatest at sea-level. The greater the altitude,
the less the pressure becomes, and the less pressure
on the outside surface of the envelope the easier it
is for the gas to expand; but this is compensated
for by the fact that the atmosphere is considerably
cooler at a high altitude.</p>

<p>There are three types of airship: the “non-rigid,”
in which the two portions, the car and the
envelope, are entirely separate portions, being held
together by means of rigging; “semi-rigged,” in
which the car is partly attached to the envelope, a
type greatly favored by French and Italians; and
the “rigid” airship, of which both car and envelope
are in the same framework. The Zeppelin is of
the latter class.</p>

<p>Like other great airships the Zeppelin does not
rely on one single balloon for “lift.” Instead,
the envelope forms merely the outer covering for
eighteen balloonettes, which can be regulated in
the matter of expansion and contraction from the
control-car of one of the three gondolas below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>We have by no means yet seen these wonderful
craft at their deadliest; the German pilots are
extremely brave men, yet lack that initiative and
dash peculiar to the British Air Service. Were
the position reversed, one dreads to think what
might happen to this country.</p>

<p>The future is all with the airship, in the rôle of
commerce-bearing aircraft. The aeroplane and all
heavier-than-air craft are of little value save as
units of war, and even then their uses are infinitesimal
when compared with those of the Zeppelin.
And the secret of the success of the Zeppelin is that
she has the “lift,” double and treble the lift of
the aeroplane, and is developing beyond belief,
whereas, in proportion, the aeroplane develops
little year by year.</p>

<p>Taking everything into consideration we must
have Zeppelins! It is imperative for the future
safety of our nation. The longer we submit thus
meekly to these aerial invasions, the longer will
the war go on. The German people in the past
have been intoxicated with Zeppelins. Weak,
hungry and dispirited, their flagging spirits have
again and again been whipped up into martial
ardor by the fantastic and bragging reports issued
by the General Staff in Berlin. One Zeppelin raid
was of more value to the moral of the German
nation than two great victories on the land. The
giant craft to them is more than a mere engine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of warfare and destruction, it is a fetish, almost a
religion; thus after every raid the bells are rung.
The streets are beflagged and decorated, and the
inhabitants become mad with joy. And we must
not consider the moral effects alone. From a
military point of view, at the time of writing the
enemy air-raids necessitate the authorities retaining
numbers of valuable aircraft and many trained
and expert pilots, not to mention anti-aircraft guns
and their crews, which would all be of great value
on the other side. Further, Germany defeated on
land, and deprived of her fleet at sea, but still in
possession of her Zeppelins, is a military power,
and a very strong military power of the future.
We, in Great Britain, have lost for ever the natural
advantage we once possessed of being an
island. Thanks to the vigilance and strength of
our Navy, we have held the narrow seas with a
firm hold, that so far no other nation has been
able to overcome. Now we are always open to
invasion from the air; and the sea, which formerly
afforded us protection, is a serious disadvantage,
in that invading aircraft can creep over those
broad lonely spaces, and come down upon us before
we are even aware of their proximity.</p>

<p>How can airships’ raids be encountered? There
are three methods. The first is, by anti-aircraft
artillery; secondly, by airship; and lastly, by aeroplane.
The first method—that of gun-fire—is extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
unreliable. This is not the fault of the
men so much, nor of the guns with which they
fire, but rather of the conditions under which they
work. Practice with anti-aircraft guns is rare and
insufficient; and the best part of the firing takes
place at night at a rapidly moving object, many
thousands of feet up in the air. Aeroplanes are
greatly handicapped by want of “lift”—a quality
which goes far to render aircraft either useful or
useless. To obtain “lift” the latter craft relies
solely on the high power of its engine, whereas,
with the Zeppelin, “lift” is obtained by two
means: one by the envelope, which contains gas
several times lighter than air; and the other, as
with the aeroplane, by engine power. Thus we
have double the lifting power with a dirigible than
with an aeroplane, and hence double, and in actual
fact treble, the war lift; and treble the amount
of bombs, ammunition, and machine-guns can be
carried.</p>

<p>The effect the enemy hopes to gain by his constant
Zeppelin raids, is partly moral, partly military.
To achieve the latter it is necessary that the
enemy airman destroy some position or place of
military importance, as a powder-factory, an arsenal,
a large camp, an important railway junction, a
munitions factory, a naval dockyard, an ordnance
factory, or a similar area. But in very few instances
have the raiding Zeppelins touched either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of these places. Thus they have achieved but
little military result. The moral result attempted
has been to frighten and harass the inhabitants of
this country until—Germany had a mental vision—they
would be groveling on their knees in the
dust, begging the Government to sue for peace.
We have already dealt with the moral effect these
raids have on their own people. By aid of lying
and bombastic reports the enemy do not fail to
impress—and greatly impress—neutral countries.
Some readers will perhaps remember it was after
a big Zeppelin raid on this country that Bulgaria
joined the Central Powers. The Germans know
only too well that we do not possess large airships
of our own. Suppose we did; what would be the
panic and consternation caused in Berlin by the
appearance over that city of a squadron of British
bomb-dropping Zeppelins, and how far would it
go to shorten the war?</p>

<p>During the last few months we have seen the
Zeppelin in a more useful and more dangerous
aspect, namely in the capacity of Naval Scout. Let
us consider what are the main duties of a light-cruiser
fleet at sea; they are of a very similar nature
to those of the cavalry, namely to form a protective
screen to the main body, and to advance as
nearly as possible to the enemy to discover the
exact disposition of his forces. In one word, their
main duty is scouting. In this respect the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
went one better than ourselves. He built Zeppelins,
and succeeded in accomplishing with a single
Zeppelin that which in former days had required
a fleet of light cruisers. Without necessarily running
any risk, the giant airship at a height of 10,000
feet has a view extending on a clear day to as
much as thirty miles, and some three-hundred
square miles of sea surface. What cruiser look-out
can claim a perspective equal to that? At
thirty miles, or twenty-five or even twenty, the
Zeppelin pilot is well out of range of the enemy
shells, and with his wireless instrument, which has
another range of thirty miles, can signal to the
admiral of the fleet when the enemy is yet sixty
miles off. This view explains the fact why the
two fleets have so seldom been at grips in the two
years of war. The enemy, by means of his aerial
scouts, must oft and again have been warned of
the proximity of the British Fleet. The official
account of the Jutland battle stated that the
weather was dull and misty; hence the Zeppelins
would have been unable successfully to perform
their usual duties.</p>

<p>The extreme radius of Zeppelin activity is usually
considered to be 600 miles out, 600 miles
home, and judged from the three principal Zeppelin
centers—Heligoland, Brussels and Friedrichshaven—embraces,
with the possible exception of
a small and unimportant portion of the west coast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of Ireland and north coast of Scotland, every city,
military camp, munition factory, dockyard and
industrial center in Great Britain.</p>

<small>LAWS OF THE AIR</small></h2>
</div>


<p>At a recent coroner’s inquest on the death of a
young Service pilot in England, an instructor of
the flying school at which he was being trained,
stated in the course of his evidence that if the pilots—there
had been a horrifying collision in mid-air—had
only been familiar with aerial rules and
regulations, the accident would never have occurred.</p>

<p>In this particular instance one machine had been
coming down, while another was just leaving the
ground. Both of the pilots were aware of the
danger they were in, but neither knew the right
course to pursue. Result—collision and death.
Had both of them carried out the Royal Aero
Club’s regulation: that an aeroplane passing another
aeroplane in mid-air must leave at least ten
meters’ space between the extreme wing-tips and
always pass to the right of the approaching craft,
both of them would have been alive to-day.</p>

<p>So very few of the public outside the flying
world are aware that, as navigation of the sea is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
ordered by the Navigation Act, so is the navigation
of the air by the Aerial Navigation Acts of
1911 and 1913, and by the rules and regulations
of the Royal Aero Club, which latter organization
previous to the war controlled all matters aeronautical
and still controls the granting of pilot’s
certificates.</p>

<p>Even in the ballooning days a charter was
drawn up at a conference at Brussels, which ordained
that every private balloon—that is to say,
one not in the hands of the naval or military authorities—must
be registered and have a name and
number, which should be printed in large letters
on the body of the balloon. The place of residence
of the owner must also be stated, and the
number and the place of origin be printed in red.
Every ascent by a private person must be under
the control of a state official. Government balloons,
on the other hand, are not expected to
carry papers, but private balloons must have a
copy of the official particulars and a list of the
passengers. A balloon must be identified in the
same way as a ship, and must carry a flag, fastened
to the net half-way down the balloon, and
this must be recognizable both by its shape and
coloring, and be properly mounted in position.
A journal must be kept and the man in charge
must produce his certificate on demand.</p>

<p>These latter rules also apply to airships, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
to aeroplanes. These types of aircraft are too
numerous to be able to identify singly, but there
are many other rules to which they must submit.
For instance—flying over London and similar
crowded areas is prohibited; or, in the words of
the R. A. C.: “Flying to the danger of the public
is prohibited, particularly unnecessary flights
over towns, or thickly populated areas, or over
places where crouds are temporarily assembled, or
over public enclosures at aerodromes at such a
height as to involve danger to the public. Flying
is also prohibited over River Regattas, Race
meetings, meetings for public games and sports,
except flights specifically arranged for in writing
with the promoters of such Regattas, Meetings,
etc.”</p>

<p>If he disregard any of these regulations, the
airman is liable to a fine not exceeding £20 and
suspension of his flying certificate.</p>

<p>The first Aerial Navigation Act of 1911 was
not in reality a Navigation Act at all, but although
that was its title, it was described as “An Act to
provide for the protection of the public against
dangers arising from the Navigation of Aircraft.”
The penalties attached thereto were exceedingly
heavy and provided that any airman disregarding
the Act would be liable after conviction on indictment
or on summary conviction to imprisonment
for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
not exceeding £200, or to both such imprisonment
and fine.</p>

<p>The Act included various prohibited flying
areas, mostly in the neighborhood of arsenals,
munition factories, and naval dockyards, or similar
military areas.</p>

<p>Certain conditions were imposed on aircraft
landing in this country from abroad, as that the
person in charge of the aircraft, before commencing
a voyage to the United Kingdom, must apply
for a clearance to a duly authorized British Consular
Officer. He must make a written application,
which states clearly the name and registered
number of the craft; the type, the name, nationality,
and the place of residence of the owner or
person in charge, and of every member of the
crew; and the name, profession, nationality and
place of residence of every passenger (if any), the
nature of the cargo (if any), the approximate
time of departure, place of departure, the intended
landing-place in the United Kingdom, the proposed
destination, and the object of the voyage.</p>

<p>Having settled the matters of procedure, it was
further added that “no person in any aircraft
entering the United Kingdom should carry, or
allow to be carried, in the aircraft, any goods, the
importation of which is prohibited by the laws relating
to customs; any goods chargeable upon importation
into the United Kingdom with any duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
or customs, except such small quantities as have
been placed on board at the place of departure,
as being necessary for the use during the voyage
of the persons conveyed therein, any photographic
apparatus, carrier or homing pigeons, explosives
or firearms, or any mails.”</p>

<p>On the return journey the aircraft is not permitted
to leave unless there be at least one British
representative, approved by the authorized officer,
on board. No photographic or wireless apparatus,
etc., shall be carried, and no mails.</p>

<p>Foreign, naval, or military aircraft must not
pass over, nor land within any port of the United
Kingdom, nor the territorial waters thereof, except
on the express invitation, or with the express
permission, previously obtained, of His Majesty’s
Government.</p>

<p>None of the foregoing orders applies to naval
or military aircraft, belonging to, or employed
in the service of His Majesty.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>AERIAL COMBAT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>With every combat in mid-air some new theory
is set up, some new conclusion arrived at, and as
yet nothing can be definite. We may say for
practical purposes that the strategical work is confined
to seaplane and airship-scouting with the
fleets at sea, and long-distance aeroplane raids into
the enemy’s country; tactical work to reconnaissance
trips over the neighborhood of the lines
and the direction of artillery fire. The battle formation
of the aeroplane squadron is now, and
will in the future be similar to that of a fleet at
sea. Even now the two methods of battle are
closely akin.</p>

<p>There are three distinct phases of aerial combat
to be considered—aeroplane <em>versus</em> aeroplane,
airship against airship, and aeroplane against airship.
It is a difficult matter to decide which is the
more useful as a fighting unit, but thus far one
is inclined to say the light, high-powered aeroplane.
Zeppelins and airships are for the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
part clumsy and unwieldly. Seaplanes, again, are
usually heavy and slow to answer to their controls.</p>

<p>The important factors are the lifting power of
the machine and weather conditions. The property
of “lift” is determined on the one hand by
mechanical devices, and on the other by the balloon
portion of the craft which is lighter than the
air. Lift spells speed, endurance, and climbing
powers, and therefore the machine with the
greater lift is the better equipped for fighting purposes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wind and Cloud</span></h3>

<p>Next in order of importance is wind. The
engine may be giving a speed of sixty miles per
hour, and the craft be flying in the teeth of a
20 m.p.h. wind, thus its actual speed would be
forty, not sixty, miles an hour. Again, two enemy
machines, A and B, are approaching one another
to give battle. Both have a speed of 60 m.p.h., but
A is flying “down” with a fifteen-mile wind at the
back of him. Their relative speeds would be:
A seventy-five, B forty-five, or an advantage of
thirty miles an hour for A; but on the turn—the
majority of aerial combats are fought out on the
principal of circling and wheeling—the advantage
would be transferred to B. Good pilotage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
is of extreme importance; the pilot who is able
to get the most out of his machine and knows it
best will almost invariably gain the day.</p>

<p>Clouds are often made great use of by pilots.
Almost every day we read of a machine dashing
out from behind a bank of cloud, and taking another
by surprise. On the other hand, clouds may
prove disastrous to both combatants, owing to the
peculiar property they possess of influencing the
stability of the machine.</p>

<p>Lift, however, is still the great factor, since the
fight always develops into a struggle for the upper
berth, and is usually fought in an upward direction.
It is climb, climb, climb; then, with the
wind at his back, a last swoop down on the enemy—taking
him in his most vulnerable position—and
the fight is over. Various expedients are made
use of to gain this end, such as getting between an
opponent and the sun, “diving” suddenly and
“looping.” With either aeroplane or airship it is
the uppermost position that counts.</p>

<p>The type of craft most useful for this work is
the high-engined biplane of the “tractor”—propeller
to the fore—type, the machine-gun firing
through the blades of the propeller. The essentials
of these machines are speed and ability to
climb quickly. The slower machines, with greater
powers of endurance, are more useful for bomb-raiding
and reconnaissance purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">“Lift” the Factor</span></h3>

<p>Airship combat has yet to materialize. Many
opinions and theories, often widely conflicting,
have been put forward concerning the possibilities
and probabilities of such conflicts, but nothing
definite can be advanced until a battle between
airships has taken place. The opinion of the majority
of the experts is that an airship would be
little better than useless to meet an airship, and
for our own particular requirements—that is, the
repelling of Zeppelin raids—aeroplanes are of
more use; which brings us to the combat between
aeroplane and airship.</p>

<p>Considering first their main qualities: the airship
has great “lifting” powers, is more heavily
armed, can climb at a faster rate, and has greater
powers of endurance; whereas the aeroplane has
greater speed, is more easily maneuvered, and is
less unwieldy.</p>

<p>The tendency of the Zeppelin commanders is
to increase rather than decrease altitude with
every raid, which renders attack by aeroplane
more difficult; but, on the other hand, aeroplanes
are being built which can develop so remarkable
a speed that they will soon be able to climb above
Zeppelin altitude. When that occurs the Zeppelin
menace will end for ever.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>THE AIR—THE WAR—AND THE FUTURE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Had either Orville or Wilbur Wright, when
they first glided down the low sand-dunes of the
Pacific shore on a frail, uncontrollable air machine,
in the earlier part of this century, or Count Zeppelin,
as he worked unceasingly on his giant airship,
been blessed with the imagination and the
gifts of a seer—what remarkable vision would
have been theirs!</p>

<p>To see that frail glider increase and grow into
a motor-propelled, double-winged aeroplane, darting
through the air with the speed of a cyclone:
that unwieldy airship, capable at the most of remaining
for half-an-hour in the air at a time, develop
into a craft, to which the crossing and
re-crossing of the wide expanse of the North Sea
was an everyday occurrence: to see the aeroplane
climb up to 18,000 feet in the sky, to attain a
speed of over 100 miles per hour, and remain in
the air for hours on end....</p>

<p>The Zeppelin originally intended to be a peaceful
carrier of the commerce of the world, converted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
into a ship of war, with machine-guns
mounted fore and aft; and with a cargo on board
deadly enough to wreck the half of a city....</p>

<p>The far-flung battle-line of Flanders, over which
there creep, like great gray wasps, French, Belgian,
German and British aeroplanes alike; the
elongated shapes of raiding Zeppelins, darting
hither and thither over a darkened London, among
piercing searchlight rays and bursting shrapnel!
Yet a few years, and the shapes and structures may
undergo even more marvelous change; for every
talent and accomplishment, every art and science
of modern civilization will be devoted to the development
of this new science of aeronautics.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The War and Aviation</span></h3>

<p>One may say, without much fear of contradiction,
that the war has done more towards the
development of aviation, and has rendered more
things possible to be done in two years than would
have been accomplished in ten years under pre-wartime
conditions.</p>

<p>It has necessitated the production of many thousands
of craft of varying degrees of size and
shape, and the number of factories engaged upon
the production of aeroplanes, airships, and spare
parts for the respective craft has trebled. For
one trained and experienced aviator, in 1914,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
there are to-day at least ten, if anything more capable,
and certainly better experienced.</p>

<p>As a test of the durability and the capabilities
of aircraft, flying under war conditions cannot be
equaled, for various reasons. Firstly, maneuvers,
which in times of peace would be considered risky
to life and thus avoided, must be endured daily by
pilots flying over the battle area. Flying under
shell-fire frequently necessitates maneuvers, entirely
unaccounted for by the constructors of the
machine, which put a very great strain on the
framework, wings, struts, etc. To compensate for
such strain, every wire, strut, and part of the
framework is constructed of a strength at least
eight times greater than that of the actual strength
required. Thus the weak points of the machine
are discovered, also the centers at which the greatest
strain takes place.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Future Types of Craft</span></h3>

<p>The shape and general build of the aeroplane
has not thus far changed materially from the original
models of Orville and Wilbur Wright, save
that the majority of the modern machines are tractors
(<i>i. e.</i> with the engine in front), whereas the
older types were “pushers” (with engine at the
rear). The new principle has naturally both advantage
and disadvantage. With the tractor engine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the machine has a great speed, and is able
to climb at a much faster rate, but the inherent
stability of the craft is seriously affected—by shifting
the engine 80 per cent. of the total weight is
moved from the center to the nose of the aeroplane.
To compensate for this the wings have
had to be extended, and this has added considerably
to the weight in aggregate. But this evil
has again been remedied, by bringing the extreme
ends further to the rear, and slightly indenting
each wing-tip: in a word, constructing the aeroplane
more and more after the fashion of a bird
in flight. Such is the peculiar working of the human
mind, however, that when some new theory
or substance is evolved, similar to the one in question,
it is content to concentrate on the original
formula, and develops that rather than apply the
same principles to an entirely new formula. Thus,
after some twelve years of flying, we have only
four distinct types of craft: the balloon, the airship,
the aeroplane, and the seaplane—the two
former being very similar both in principle and
shape, as also the two latter. Exception cannot
be made for the “triplane,” for that machine,
with three planes, has the same shape as the aeroplane.</p>

<p>The principles of aero-statics, and aero-dynamics
by no means confine the constructor to these
two standard forms; and in the near future the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
aeroplane will be built on similar lines to the
ocean-going liner, and the airship very much on
the same principle.</p>

<p>Development in size and speed depend on future
experimenting, and flights have already been
made both in France and Russia by giant aeroplanes,
in which, in one case nine, and in the other
fifteen passengers, exclusive of the pilot were
carried at one time; while the later Zeppelins are
capable of lifting to a height of over 12,000 feet,
a crew of thirty odd, with a further weight of
bombs and war material aboard, and flying distances
of over 800 miles. Again, there are the
orthropic and the ornithropic types of craft, which
their inventors claim to be capable of rising vertically
from the ground to a height of 10,000 feet.
Combining these principles we ought within the
space of ten years to be in possession of aircraft
capable of flying at over 150 miles an hour, with
a cargo of many hundred tons aboard, and with a
radius of over 3,000 miles, able to start and land
with ease in a confined space about the size of
Leicester Square. The aerial landing grounds
will be the flat roofs of gigantic buildings specially
constructed in the center of London. Automatic
lifts will convey the passengers from the air level
to the street level, where they will be deposited in
electric trains, running in all directions. Impracticable,
say the critics, but so they said when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Count Zeppelin and the Wrights first started their
experiments.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Properties of War and Peace Machines</span></h3>

<p>There is not, and there never was, on this earth
a new idea so well deserving of examination as
the science of Aeronautics. The history of that
science deals with the most momentous invention
in the history of civilization. No other science
allures the imagination so far forward into the
dim future, when the business of the world will
be carried up from the level of the sea and the
land to that of mid-air, and when travel will be
so rapid and safe that space will almost cease to
be an obstacle to man’s communications.</p>

<p>The proudest inventions of the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries are but of yesterday
when compared with those of the aeroplane and
airship. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance
that we should consider how the development of
aeronautics will affect the future of the human
race. Under the present war-time conditions, there
exists a grave danger that the aeroplane and the
airship will be developed too much for war purposes
to the detriment of future commercial uses.
The qualities mainly required by the war machine,
speed, ability to climb quickly, and compactness,
differ entirely from those required by the peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
time or commerce-bearing aircraft, which have
ability to remain in the air for a great space of
time, and to fly greater distances. The extra speed
required by the war machine may easily be dispensed
with in the commerce-bearing machines, as
also may altitude, for whereas the war machine
must fly at a height of over 12,000 feet, a height
of between 2000 and 3000 will suffice under ordinary
conditions, and it will be at this altitude
that the best part of the flying will take place after
the war.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Future Navies and Armies of the World</span></h3>

<p>How will aviation affect warfare in the future?
Will it abolish entirely this undesirable condition
of affairs, or will it serve to provide added inducements?
It is, indeed, a debatable point. If we
incline to the latter view, every known argument
and theory points to the fact that warfare of the
future will be to all intents and purposes instantaneous.
There will be no preparatory delay
caused by the necessity of placing large armies in
the field, of gradually marching forward to establish
contact with the enemy, and of carrying
out skirmishes which may be prolonged to weeks
and months before the actual battle takes place.
The belligerent fleets will set off in the dawn or in
the darkness, as the case may be, and before twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
hours have elapsed, after entering into the conflict,
a definite decision will have been reached.
For the airman, there is no falling back to a second
line of trenches, to a natural position heavily
defended, or to a concrete fortress or emplacement,
or to fight a rearguard action. The fight
in the air must be to the death, without quarter
asked or given, for no prisoners can be taken.
The loss of men and material will be tremendous.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether aviation will entirely do
away with fighting on land and sea, but it is very
obvious that either fleet or army of one belligerent
nation, at the mercy of the air fleet of another
nation, will be in a very helpless position. Should
the warfare in the air be indecisive, were such a
condition within the realm of reasonable argument,
it might be possible for the fleet or army to
be brought into action with advantage, but even
this is doubtful. As regards our own nation, before
1926, the Royal Naval Air Service will be
the largest and most important service in Great
Britain. Possibly there will be a single Air Service,
and before ten years will have elapsed it will
be the most important of all the British services,
and will be composed both of aeroplanes and airships.
The only other form of aircraft, the seaplane,
being too slow, too clumsy, and too costly,
will long ago have been abandoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peace and War Uses of Aircraft</span></h3>

<p>Before we enter upon the discussion which is
the subject of this paragraph we wish to guard
ourselves against one misconception. It is possible
that readers of this chapter may already have
come to the conclusion that it is possible to develop
aircraft for one purpose, and one purpose only:
that is, either for war or for commerce; and impossible
to develop them for both. This would
be an entirely erroneous idea. It is true that we
have already laid stress upon the fact that there
is a very imminent danger that aircraft may be
developed too greatly for war purposes to the
detriment of others, but provided that the necessary
precautions are taken, there is yet ample time
for the commerce-carrying machine to be developed
at the same time and in the same manner
as the war machine. Within a very short time we
may find that the Super-Zeppelin of the air will
have entirely replaced not only the Dreadnought
of the sea, but also the giant passenger liners.
Both the war and the peace craft will be considerably
larger in size than the 1916 type; the balloon
portion of the Zeppelin will have trebled itself
in size; it will be, if anything, of greater
length and of slimmer formation, while the covering
will be composed of some light but durable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
metal, such as aluminium, to prevent the possibility
of explosion of gas caused by the firing of the
guns. The narrow gondola beneath will be wider,
and will mount several guns of 4.7-inch or larger
caliber: for although the Zeppelin of the future
will be a much more stable and airworthy craft, by
reason of its lateral stability it will never be possible
to fire a gun of any size from either bow or
stern of an airship or a Zeppelin, without bringing
the whole craft canting over, and possibly
breaking its back. Thus, all Super-Zeppelins of
the future will be heavily armed amidships, that
is to say, where the proportion of strain on the
craft is least felt. The passenger-carrying variety
will differ very slightly from the war machine,
save that the gondola will be deeper, more
graceful, and more on the lines of the hull of the
present-day ocean-going ship or steamer. The
Parseval and similar types of large airship will
replace the cruiser and the battle-cruiser; also the
large cargo-bearing steamers of to-day.</p>

<p>With regard to the aeroplane, we are already
in possession of super-craft, some of double engine
variety, the Sykorsky, the giant Russian machine,
and the triplane, or three-planed aeroplane;
but it is extremely doubtful whether it is possible
for the aeroplane, being a heavier type of aircraft,
to develop into a much larger size than it is to-day;
the reason for this being the abnormal engine-power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
that would be required to lift such a
craft from the ground, and the fact that the extra
weight thus occasioned would render the whole
craft unairworthy. However, the aeroplane will
fulfill in the future the uses of the light-cruiser and
the torpedo-boat, while a sort of seaplane submarine
will fulfill the double purpose of both over
and under water work.</p>

<p>As a commercial vessel the aeroplane will only
be of use for the conveyance of passengers and
light cargoes on short voyages from Great Britain
to Ireland, Great Britain to France, Holland,
Norway, or Russia.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Balance of Power</span></h3>

<p>The new method of warfare will not influence
to any material extent the present condition of international
politics. Of all the Great Powers,
however, Great Britain will be more nearly affected.
For many centuries past we have relied upon
our natural geographical position, as an island, to
protect us from all invasion. And to retain this
insular and impregnable position we have relied
upon our glorious Navy, which is, and always has
been, mistress of the seas. But now we are no
longer an island; that is to say, we are no longer
protected from the attacks of an enemy merely because
we are surrounded by sea, even although we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
maintain the supremacy of our naval power. Another
element has now to be considered, namely,
the air, and that, unfortunately, we do not hold
with the same mastery that we did the sea. It will
be seen, therefore, that for the safety of the Empire,
we must immediately build up a great air
fleet, and gain the supremacy of the air. Germany
has already shown us the lead in this respect, and
we must not be content to follow, but to improve,
greatly improve, upon that lead. One thing is
certain, that the mad extravagant race for armaments
among the nations will continue, but
with this difference—that it will be for great fleets
of the air, as to-day it is for large armies and
great sea fleets.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Future Influences</span></h3>

<p>Thus far we have dealt solely with the influences
of aviation upon warfare and upon commerce;
but such influences will by no means be confined
to these two phases; there are many other
features in international life that the development
of aeronautics will influence greatly. Foremost
amongst them is that of travel. For the first few
years the cost of travel in the air will be appreciably
greater than is now the case. One of the leading
aeronautical experts of the day has computed
that, to run a commercial service of aircraft, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
cover the heavy expenditure that will be incurred,
and to allow for the wear and tear of machines,
it will be necessary to make a charge of 1½<i>d.</i> per
mile, or a 50 per cent. increase on the rates for
present day travel by steamer and railway. Once
the project is in full swing, however, and the
initial outlay has been recovered, such charge will
be reduced to one halfpenny per mile, or 50 per
cent. less than present conditions.</p>

<p>In the matter of speed and time, there will be
a remarkable advantage; for example, some of
the proposed air routes are London to New York
in 18 hours, London to Capetown in 54, and
London to Sydney (Australia) in four days. This
added economy and speed will tempt the traveling
public, and for that matter the non-traveling public
further afield, and will serve greatly to help
on education and the rapid development of the
remotest of our colonies, thus drawing closer the
bond of union between the different portions of
our great Empire. Countries and tracts of land
hitherto undeveloped and unknown will be opened
up by the aerial explorer, and whole continents
will, with the greatest ease, be policed by aeroplane
and by airship.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Future War with Germany</span></h3>

<p>Will this war be followed by an aerial war between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Germany and Great Britain at a no distant
date? This depends solely on the future course
and the conclusion of the present war.</p>

<p>After some fourteen years’ experimenting, inventing
and developing, and the expenditure of
several millions of money, Count Zeppelin, or
rather the very considerable staff of experts which
he has at his disposal, produced the modern Zeppelin:
that is to say, the craft that has been in use
since the outbreak of the war. What Germany’s
policy was in constructing these huge craft it is
not difficult to discover. Previous to August,
1914, when her navy was inferior to only one
other in the world, and that our own, and she was
gradually gaining upon us both in the number of
ships and <em>personnel</em>, very little was heard of the
airship program: the industry was given State
encouragement; but then, to our cost, we know
that the enemy has always encouraged any new
enterprise that was likely to prove of value from
a military point of view. War was declared. Our
gallant Fleet, by a series of brilliant engagements,
succeeded in driving the enemy shipping from the
seas of the world, and in bottling up the Kaiser’s
grand fleet in the Kiel Canal, where it has ever
since remained. What effect did this have on the
aircraft, and more particularly the Zeppelin, industry
in Germany? Labor was instantly withdrawn
from the shipbuilding yards, and turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
over to the construction of Zeppelins. In the early
stages of the war the output stood at approximately
one a month; this soon crept up to a
couple a month, then to three, then to one a week,
and now to-day they claim that two Zeppelins per
week are being turned out by the factories that
have sprung up in nearly every large town in the
German Empire. What do all these events portend?
Those who know the German and his characteristics
intimately, tell us that at the back of
every German mind, the keenest of all desires is
an invasion of England. The reason for this bitter
hatred is that the British Empire is on every
hand an obstacle to the development of Germany;
we were their keenest trade rivals, their most dangerous
enemy in the matter of world supremacy,
and we were successful in establishing colonies,
an ambition dear to every German heart.</p>

<p>There can only be two objects in view in the
mind of the German Imperial Staff: the one is a
gigantic air raid on this country, as a last resource
during the present war; the other, a determination
on the part of Germany, after the present war is
ended and forgotten, to gain a considerable
ascendancy in the air, and thus once more to take
her place as a martial power among the nations.
To prevent this, it will be necessary for us not
only to destroy her armies on the land, and her
fleets at sea, but also her fleets of aircraft; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Germany, though beaten by land and sea, and still
in possession of her aircraft, will remain for ever
a menace to the civilized world.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
